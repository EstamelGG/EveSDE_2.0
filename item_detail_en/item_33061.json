  "description": "During the year YC 111 there was an incident in which a capsuleer posted a truly legitimate question on the public network and asked for some assistance in answering it. Shortly after posting his question the public network was filled with jokes about the man's chin. It is unknown if he ever got an answer to his question but we know for sure that for a period of time after his public post the only words to follow the man were \"dude, your chin!\"\n\nIt is for reasons like this that one must be careful about choosing what portrait they present to the public. By the end of this book you will understand how to properly select a good public portrait that properly represents you.\n\nThe person in the above story has since had surgery that changed his appearance and so we dedicate the cover of this book to his original look.",
