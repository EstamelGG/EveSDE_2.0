  "description": "The Imperial bureaucracy is typically hesitant to adopt equipment sourced from external corporations but the Amarr Ministry of Assessment has found its version of the Exploration Suit to be uncommonly useful in its work of surveying and exploring celestial bodies throughout Amarr space.\n\nSeeing an opportunity in the market for variable atmosphere and gravity exploration gear, the Impro corporation developed its 'Impro-XS' integrated clothing and equipment line. The gear's superior environmental adaptation technology resulted in a rapid take up from various corporations across New Eden.",
