  "name": "Large Group of The Hooded Men",
  "description": "Unlike most pro-Minmatar mercenary companies, members of The Hooded Men come from every empire and any background; they are selected for their convictions and skills rather than any sense of patriotism they might possess. Even Amarr are permitted to join, provided they can prove that the company means more to them than their religion. The Hooded Men's founder, Jolmiar Maritak, the grandson of former slaves who fled to the Gallente Federation, places emphasis on getting their work done quietly and with a minimum of fuss.",
