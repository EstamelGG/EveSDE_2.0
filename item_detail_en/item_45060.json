  "description": "This set of blueprints was almost lost to the ages, and is now very valuable in certain circles. Only partially complete due to data degradation, it details an Imperial frigate of unknown class, roughly the same dimensions and mass as the Punisher. Also included are partial details on a proprietary antimatter reactor design, as well as instructions for proper radioactive decontamination and disposal of slaves used to construct and install it in the vessel's chassis.",
