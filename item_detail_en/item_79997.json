  "description": "This Abyssal Filament will pull a <b>single Exploration or Covert Ops Frigate</b> into a pocket of Abyssal Deadspace with an environment disrupted by massive electrical storms that will <b>reduce EM resistance</b> but <b>enhance ship capacitor recharging</b>.\n\nSOCT scientists detected a massive energy spike in the filaments target sector followed by a cessessation of signals. This indicates a large-scale battle which none survived. With the site abandoned, Capsuleers are urged to equip their ships with relic analyzers and recover any valuable artefacts.\n\nAs the conduits are in collapse, space and time around them have become warped to the point of being insulated entirely. As a result, exiting the safe space via one side will appear like entering it from the other.\n\nThe pocket is categorized as 'easy' and should be manageable for capsuleers with limited hacking experience.\n\n<b><color=yellow>Warning:</color></b> Abyssal Deadspace is a particularly harsh and unforgiving environment. After <b><color=yellow>30 minutes</color></b> catastrophic collapse of the warp field is predicted, with <b><color=yellow>destruction of the ship and capsule</color></b> certain.\n\nTriglavian Origin Conduits will permit the activating ship to return to normal space.",
