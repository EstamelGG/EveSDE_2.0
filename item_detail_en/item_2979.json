  "description": "Not all scrap-metal is of good enough quality to be reused in the shipbuilding industry. These are the highest quality to be found in the scrap-heaps and abandoned battlegrounds of New Eden. Some pieces still bear signs of what they were once a part of: a sheet of tinted plating here, a painted logo there. Some pieces are still recognizable, others are half-slagged and warped.",
