  "description": "Emerging as a new powerhouse on the Tournament landscape, the <url=showinfo:16159//551692893>HYDRA RELOADED</url> team in the Eighth Alliance Tournament easily stood out from the pack both on and off the field. They crushed all opposition until the finals, and their metagame duels of will with arch-nemesis <url=showinfo:16159//386292982>Pandemic Legion</url> between the matches became the stuff of legend. Although defeated by <url=showinfo:16159//386292982>Pandemic Legion</url> in the finals, they would eventually have their revenge in the subsequent year.",
