  "name": "Fermionic Condensates",
  "description": "One of the most complex composites known to man, fermionic condensates consist of superconductive boson particles all occupying the same quantum state, thus creating a nearly resistance-free environment for electric current. These condensates have therefore become a staple in advanced reactor manufacture.",
