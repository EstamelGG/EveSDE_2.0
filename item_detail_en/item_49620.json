  "description": "Chromodynamic Tricarboxyls may be unstable but they have many uses, including use as a catalyzing material in synaptic acceleration implants and boosters.  A darker use is the refinement of the strange material into \"Deathglow\", a deeply mind-altering illegal booster that has recently found its way into the underground markets of New Eden.\n\nThis particular batch of Deathglow has decayed into a toxic mess and would probably be enough to drop a Matigu Seabeast stone-cold dead, if you could find one.",
