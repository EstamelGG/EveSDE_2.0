  "name": "New Eden Genome Amalgam",
  "description": "This peculiar object was extracted from a device intended to build a neural lace in the brain of any given subject from the various races of New Eden. While it is now inert, the structure of the object suggests that it is a nanite amalgam containing the necessary material and encoding to establish and adapt a unique neural lace according to the genetic makeup of the subject. It does appear to lack a source of energy and a control framework. This must have been provided by the device it was extracted from.\n\nThis object and its novel use of nanotechnology raises many questions.",
