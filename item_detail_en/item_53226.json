  "description": "A version of the successful 'TorsoRig' line of body augmentations offered by Wiyrkomi Industrial Biomechanics, the SteelKnight TorsoRig is a powerful enhancement of upper body strength, speed and precision. This general purpose body augmentation derives from a model of combat rigs Wiyrkomi supplied to the Royal Khanid Navy to be used by the so-called 'Cyber Knights' of the Khanid Kingdom.\n\nThe science and technology of enhancing biomechanics using cybernetic rigs and meshes is advancing all the time with much effort focused on lowering the barrier of entry in terms of manufacturing and resources that make up the cost of such powerful augmentations.",
