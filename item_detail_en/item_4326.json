  "description": "<b>Paper:</b> Project Enigma - The Jovian Empires<br>\n<b>Lead Researcher:</b> Myyona<br>\n<b>Contributors:</b> None<br>\n<b>Summary:</b> The Jovian society was the first to recover after the closure of the EVE Gate, an event that caused a near-complete extinction of all human settlements in New Eden. Having existed for thousands of years since then, the Jovian Empire experienced peaks and falls long before any of the other currently existing empires even managed to establish themselves as spacefaring nations. \n\nBeing keen seekers of knowledge, the Jovians possess great insight on past events, though they do not share it freely and easily with outsiders. This paper looks into the documentation available on the history of the Jovian Empires in an attempt to better understand the Jove mentality and the current state of the Jovian society. Evidence gathered for the paper suggests that the recent lack of communication from Jovian officials, as well as their seeming inability to stop the fatal Jovian Disease, may signal that the current Jovian Empire is in decline.\n\n<i>This abstract relates to research undertaken by the Arek'Jaalan Project.</i>\n\n<i>Authorized for capsuleer dissemination under the CONCORD Freedom of Distribution Act (Alpha-One-Five), YC 113.11.4</i>\n\n<i>Further copies of this document can be obtained through the Arek'Jaalan administrative site, located in the <a href=showinfo:5//30003413>Eram</a> system.<i>",
