  "description": "Subversive elements across New Eden have found something attractive, even uplifting in Zorya Triglav's message of \"proving and joining the flow\". The radicals of the Internal Triglavian Revolutionary Organization, also known as \"Intriguerre\", claim that the Triglavian invasion represents \"a dynamic moment of challenge and opportunity for posthumanity\".\n\nDespite being hunted by agents of CONCORD's Special Affairs for Regulations and Order (SARO), Intriguerre has continued to propagandize in support of the Collective and pro-Triglavian capsuleers. Contact and active co-operation between the Triglavian Collective and Intriguerre is certain given their distribution of Bioadaptive Kybernaut Combat Suits. Disturbingly, for CONCORD, the suits appear to be based on DED issue equipment with heavy internal modification to include Triglavian bioadaptive technology.\n\nAwarded in the name of Zorya Triglav, this Bioadaptive Kybernaut Combat Suit has apparently been developed to assist the most promising Kybernauts with integration into the Triglavian Collective's way of life.",
