  "description": "This implant is listed in the DED inventory as a modification by CONCORD weapons technologists of standard capsuleer implant templates with control routines that mimic methods of enhancing the firepower of reverse-engineered Triglavian weaponry, at the cost of a slower build up to maximum particle stream output.\n\nHowever, persistent rumors among New Eden's capsuleer, transhuman and wirehead communities suggest that the research and development group that created these implants was lead by a Society of Conscious Thought team with special expertise in so-called \"restricted artificial intelligences\". The possibility that these implants are based on RAI technology raises startling questions about the nature of the \"mimesis\" involved in these augmentations.\n\nAs it based on a standard Omega control implant, this augmentation does nothing in and of itself, but when used in conjunction with other Mimesis implants it will boost their effect considerably.\n\nSet Effect: 65% bonus to the strength of all Mimesis implant secondary effects",
