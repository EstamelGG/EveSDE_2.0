  "description": "Chromodynamic Tricarboxyls may be unstable but they have many uses, including use as a catalyzing material in synaptic acceleration implants and boosters. A darker use is the refinement of the strange material into \"Deathglow\", a deeply mind-altering illegal booster that has recently found its way into the underground markets of New Eden.\n\nThis evil-smelling substance is the residue from Deathglow refining and while it's not particularly dangerous, it's not recommended to apply it to your eyeballs.",
