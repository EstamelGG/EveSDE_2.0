  "description": "Spaceship safety display issued by InterBus to warn against misplacing essential tools when working aboard ship. The weird, multi-tool-fingered Tool-Swiper Clone features in a comical image that warns crew to be careful with their tools and always return them to the proper stowage or lockers.\n\nNew Eden's Yoiul Festival to mark the end of one year and the start of a new one has become a universally popular family holiday, especially among those living and working in the space industries. Personnel transport traffic increases markedly during this period to accommodate the movement of workers visiting their families, and safety aboard spaceships is a paramount issue of concern.\n\nUsing old spacer tales of clone blanks coming to life and wreaking havoc aboard ship, InterBus has issued a series of animated safety displays warning passengers and crew alike against hazards, carelessness, and waste. Although cartoonish, the safety displays deal with serious risks to life and limb aboard a working spaceship.",
