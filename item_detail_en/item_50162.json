  "name": "Semiosis Conduction Console (Perun Clade)",
  "description": "This self-contained unit seems to be a device combining a number of sophisticated interfaces with internal processing and storage capacity geared towards symbolic or conceptual modelling. The device evidently provides for communication of constructed models either through its built-in holographic and nanomemetic functions, or via a variety of outputs if these are connected to an appropriate network. It is possible that the device also incorporates quantum entanglement communications technology.\n\nPut simply, this would appear to be a Triglavian computing device with a variety of built-in communications capabilities. This particular console has internal power and displays the symbol of the \"Perun Clade\" in standby mode.\n\n<b>CONCORD would no doubt prefer this device be handed over to them but the curious could probably keep it and carefully monitor it without too much risk. Probably.</b>",
