  "name": "Kri'tak Knife",
  "description": "Kri’taks are combat knives commonly used by Minmatar, based off a traditional Sebiestor ice pick called the ci’nal. Tools like the ci’nal were used by northern Sebiestor clans to break apart ice, though only a few clans still use them since the development of high-tech cutters and refrigeration units. Kri’taks retain the stiletto shape of the original ci’nal, but their blade is broadened and edged.\n\nKri’taks have become a standard weapon for Valklear Special Forces. Like the nova knives used by planetside armies and clone mercenaries, Valklear kri’taks have rapidly-oscillating edges that greatly enhance the knife’s ability to cut through dense material.",
