  "name": "Pax Amarria",
  "description": "Written by Heideran VII, the Amarr Emperor himself, Pax Amarria is the most remarkable book published in the last century. In it the Emperor writes about his hopes and dreams for peace throughout the galaxy; a vision that has propelled him into becoming the champion of improved interstellar relations. His relentless strive for these goals has brought unparalleled harmony in the relationship between the empires; his constant search for peaceful solutions to any problem having many times becalmed brewing storms of hostilities on the horizon. His determination and powers of persuasion have compelled his own people and others to sacrifice many things they thought sacred to ensure that tranquillity will prevail, now and forever.",
