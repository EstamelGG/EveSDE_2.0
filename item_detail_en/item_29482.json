  "description": "Ghalen dumplings are variants of the more common Ghalen pastries. The dumplings have far less filling, if any, and usually consist merely of rice balls rolled in leaves and then deep-fried. On holy days, they are eaten without any condiment or side dish, but in recent times they've gained vast popularity with young consumers, who tend to dip them in all manner of spicy sauces.",
