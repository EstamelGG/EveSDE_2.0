  "description": "The Semiotique TorsoRig provides the user with powerful enhancements to upper body strength, speed and precision. This version of Wiyrkomi Industrial Biomechanics' TorsoRig line has been specially commissioned to mark the launch of the Semiotique Sports brand by one of the biggest players in New Eden's communications and media landscape.\n\nSemiotique Superluminal is one of New Eden's largest FTL communications corporations, owned by the reclusive and eccentric trillionaire Lous Chavol, founder of the Scope and an immensely powerful figure in the Gallente Federation's corporate world. From its beginnings as one of the more successful FTL communications companies during the last expansion phase of the Gallente Federation, Semiotique has become a megacorporation that may even rival the titanic Quafe Company for its reach.\n\nIn recent decades, Semiotique Superluminal has expanded its activities into all manner of technology, media, and entertainment interests. The holocasting and virtuality industries are a major growth area for the corporation, and under its Semiotique Sports brand it has ambitious plans to expand into popular high-tech sports such as Gravball, Mind Clash, spaceship racing, and even the controversial but incredibly lucrative combat sports field.",
