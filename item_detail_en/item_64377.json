  "name": "Women's Amarr Devotional Robe",
  "description": "This robe is made of fine fabrics and styled in a relatively plain yet refined manner to fit the purpose of a garment intended to be worn by high status Amarr for devotional purposes. Such a robe might be worn by minor nobles or wealthy commoners when visiting the local basilica or when making a pilgrimage to any of the many thousands of holy sites scattered across the vastness of the Amarr Empire. Even the most elevated nobles might choose to wear such a robe when they especially wish to emphasize their piety and attention to religious duties over more worldly concerns.",
