  "description": "Harkening back to the days where even the most experienced spacefarers needed protection from the bruising of the elements, this elegant, yet rough-and-tumble design shows that the wearer has seen their own share of action and is unquestionably ready for more.\n\nA maroon nanofiber-laced harness locks in seamlessly on the front, while the dark red sides are composed of thin but untearable material that leads to pads covering major joints in the upper body, the ensemble giving the all-over impression that the wearer has been immersed in blood that is more than likely to be someone else's. A capsuleer wearing this jacket is ready for a fight, both in and out of the pod.",
