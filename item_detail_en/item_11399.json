  "description": "Morphite is a highly unorthodox mineral that can only be found in the hard-to-get <a href=showinfo:11396>mercoxit</a> ore. It is hard to use morphite as a basic building material, but when it is joined with existing structures it can enhance the performance and durability manifold. This astounding quality makes this the material responsible for ushering in a new age in technology breakthroughs.\n\nMay be obtained by reprocessing <a href=showinfo:11396>mercoxit</a> ore and its variations which are available in null security status star systems.",
