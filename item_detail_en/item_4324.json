Both use DNA as the genetic material, and both use the same 26 amino acids for building proteins. In addition, the genetic code (that is, which combinations of three nucleotides code for which amino acid) is the same for both humans and life in Anoikis. As the genetic code is arbitrary, the chance of this happening by accident is one in ten to the 26th power. We are forced to conclude that life in Anoikis and human life sprang from the same source.\n\nFurther investigation into how this could have come to be is the topic of another paper: <a href=showinfo:4336>The Origin of Life in Anoikis.</a>\n\n<i>This abstract relates to research undertaken by the Arek'Jaalan Project.</i>\n\n<i>Authorized for capsuleer dissemination under the CONCORD Freedom of Distribution Act (Alpha-One-Five), YC 113.11.4</i>\n\n<i>Further copies of this document can be obtained through the Arek'Jaalan administrative site, located in the <a href=showinfo:5//30003413>Eram</a> system.<i>",
