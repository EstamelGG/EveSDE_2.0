  "name": "Fragment Inscribed with Odd Circular Text",
  "description": "This object appears to be a fragment of a larger textual work, the script of which defies any language known in New Eden. The script features strangely ornate text, arranged in a series of circular patterns. Though it is clear that the pictographs are meant to represent some form of communicative language, the meaning of it will remain elusive.",
