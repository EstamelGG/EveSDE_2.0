  "description": "<b>Paper:</b> Project Slipstream - Wormhole Physics for Capsuleers<br>\n<b>Lead Researcher:</b> Helen Ohmiras<br>\n<b>Contributors:</b> Rhavas, Pat Irvam<br>\n<b>Summary:</b> Artificial wormhole induction processes are used in warp drives and jump drives across New Eden. Despite the prevalence of this technology, natural wormholes are still a mystery to many. A pilot with a firm grasp of wormhole mechanics can make more effective decisions when unforeseen and unpredicted events occur in the future.\n\nProject Slipstream is an attempt to educate the wider capsuleer community on basic wormhole physics. We will focus on clearing up misconceptions regarding the difference between natural wormholes and artificial wormholes. The nature of wormholes present in the uncharted regions will also be determined. These findings will then be used as a starting point for further clarification of the physics behind the technology used to create artificial wormholes, as well as other wormhole induction drive technologies.\n\n<i>This abstract relates to research undertaken by the <a href=evebrowser: http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Arek%27Jaalan>Arek'Jaalan Project.</a></i>\n\n<i>Authorized for capsuleer dissemination under the CONCORD Freedom of Distribution Act (Alpha-One-Five), YC 113.11.4</i>\n\n<i>Further copies of this document can be obtained through the Arek'Jaalan administrative site, located in the <a href=showinfo:5//30003413>Eram</a> system.<i>",
