  "description": "Galeptos is a rare type of medicine developed by the famous Gallentean scientist, Darven Galeptos. It is produced from a blend of organic and chemical material, used to cure a rare and deadly viral infection which has been creeping up more frequently as of late.  \n\nRumor has it that Galeptos manufactured the virus himself, then sold the cure for billions of ISK. Of course his corporation, Galeptos Medicines, steadfastly denies any such \"unfounded\" accusations and has threatened legal action to anyone who mentions it in public.",
