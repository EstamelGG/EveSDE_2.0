  "description": "This dossier appears to be an excerpt of  internal employee profiling done by Nugoeihuvi Corporation.<br><br>“…Isha is something of an enigma, even to the few of us who know him. Apparently he's spent over 30 years here at NOH. Nobody has many details since he doesn't seem to keep any staff. I've heard he makes use of pod pilots whenever he needs anything done but I've no idea where the funds for that come from, perhaps the NOH directorate. <br><br>“My House of Records contacts tell me he started work here in the Internal Security division of NOH. He now works in another department, unofficially titled as “Advisory”. It's anyone's guess when he moved across or what his work entails. In situations like these nobody asks questions.”",
