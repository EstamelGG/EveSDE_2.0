  "description": "The GDN line of safety and combat optical systems began humbly, used only by a small number of Caldari PMCs — that is, until the YC 113 action holoreel sequel <i>Smash 4 the State</i> shot the GDN-8 firmly in the public's collective eye. Now, GDN-9 “Nightstalker” cosmetic goggles will fulfill your desire to own the GDN-8 without the need to purchase military-grade electronics or radiation-proofing.",
