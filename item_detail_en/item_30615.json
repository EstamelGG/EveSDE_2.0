  "description": "Recovered from amongst the debris of a Sleeper facility, this ancient device is locked into a slow decline. Just one of these items holds countless nanoassemblers inside, offering a comprehensive view of the finer details in the Sleeper's defensive systems. Unfortunately, a great deal of the assemblers inside this one have fused together, causing a terminal chain reaction inside the device.\n\nEven though it is badly damaged, a skilled scientist could still possibly extract enough information to try and reverse engineer it.",
