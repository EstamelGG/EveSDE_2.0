  "name": "Men's 'Marshal' Jacket (Blood Raiders black/red)",
  "description": "This jacket indicates, with a casual but deadly certainty, that the wearer is a proud supporter of the Blood Raiders. Its slanted lines in pitch black over the shoulder and forearms give the impression of a potential for unimaginable speed. Meanwhile, the crimson hues running up front and back - in a column rising through the spine and chest and eventually fountaining up through the shoulders - remind any onlookers that they're looking at a man of immense power.",
