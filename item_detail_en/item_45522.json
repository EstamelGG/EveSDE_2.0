  "name": "Men's ORE Claim Surveyor Suit",
  "description": "The Outer Ring Excavations corporation employs large numbers of claim surveyors throughout New Eden, often supplementing the ranks of this dangerous profession with freelancers issued with ORE credentials. The common uniform of these rough and ready frontier operators is an adapted exploration suit bearing the ORE logo and colors.\n\nSeeing an opportunity in the market for variable atmosphere and gravity exploration gear, the Impro corporation developed its 'Impro-XS' integrated clothing and equipment line. The gear's superior environmental adaptation technology resulted in a rapid take up from various corporations across New Eden.",
