  "name": "Tarot of St. Jamyl",
  "description": "The so-called \"Tarot of St. Jamyl\" began to circulate at the fringes of the Amarrian faithful not long after the death of Empress Jamyl I. Decks of cards illustrated with religious iconography for use in various rituals have a long, if chequered, history in the Amarr Empire. While many are drawn from traditional Amarr iconography, a large number of tarot designs are considered heretical or blasphemous. \n\nThe Tarot of St. Jamyl's status is ambiguous as, while extreme Jamylite and Sarumite sects make use of the cards, the association with the heroic figure of Empress Jamyl has stayed the hands of the Ministry of Internal Order or the Theology Council courts so far. However, rumors of Sani Sabik use of this tarot set, coupled with Jamylite excesses, is attracting ever greater scrutiny by the MIO's heretic hunters.",
