  "name": "Hybrid Slaver Hounds",
  "description": "Hybrid slaver hounds have been genetically engineered by Amarr veterinary scientists as variants of the original breed. These animals are designed specifically to live and work in the harshest environments, including deserts, swamps, mountains, frozen tundra, and other extreme locations. These variations are typically easy to differentiate from the original breed, in that they can be much larger and have fur colorations that are genetically tailored to blend in to their environments.",
