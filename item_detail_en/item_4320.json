Project Theta aims to achieve this goal by repurposing and reverse engineering available rogue drone technology to create a communications subnet intended to interface with the more advanced rogue drone networks.\n\nThe three-unit communications system includes an override of the present comms systems, designed as a protective measure. It has also been designed to provide on-the-fly encoding and decoding. Future testing will be necessary to determine if the system will work as required.\n\nBased on the <a href=showinfo:23678>Aether Hive Link</a> the network remains experimental, and will be part of an isolated communications system. Recent lab tests have indicated a bandwidth of at least ten times that which is available to typical businesses.\n\n<i>This abstract relates to research undertaken by the Arek'Jaalan Project.</i>\n\n<i>Authorized for capsuleer dissemination under the CONCORD Freedom of Distribution Act (Alpha-One-Five), YC 113.11.4</i>\n\n<i>Further copies of this document can be obtained through the Arek'Jaalan administrative site, located in the <a href=showinfo:5//30003413>Eram</a> system.<i>",
