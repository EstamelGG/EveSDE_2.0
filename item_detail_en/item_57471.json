  "description": "Reaction-Orienting Trigger Neurolink Conduits are vital components in the network of connections linking the neural hardware of a capsuleer to the many key systems of a spaceship.\n\nWhile all capsuleer neurolink technologies rely on the autonomic biosystems of pilots, Caldari research and development pursued the avenue of using autonomic nervous reaction-orientation to establish a reliable integration of neurolinks with ship systems.",
