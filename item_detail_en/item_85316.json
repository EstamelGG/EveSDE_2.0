  "description": "Left behind by ancient Jovian explorers, the original purpose of this artifact is a mystery. A scan suggests it has been inactive for centuries, yet even in this state, it subtly warps the surrounding fabric of spacetime.\n\nThough nonfunctional, this device can still provide researchers valuable insights into Jovian technology. The Deathless Circle offers unique trades for Atavum in Zarzakh, while the Society of Conscious Thought will pay for any delivered to their stations.",
