  "description": "This document is issued to all graduate capsuleers, regardless of their ethnicity or background. \n\nIn the document, various fundamental human rights are outlined and defended, including the freedom to travel, freedom to work for a corporation of one's choosing, and freedom of speech within Gallente Federation borders. \n\nThe document is somewhat redundant for capsuleers, who enjoy these freedoms and others even greater. Despite this obvious fact, the Federation authorities have chosen to issue the license all the same, viewing it as a symbolic gesture, and a reminder of the Federation's core values.",
