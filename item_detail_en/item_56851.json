  "description": "The Jita 4-4 station's immense level of market activity means that it plays host to one of the largest concentrations of executives in New Eden. Not only does overseeing all aspects of such a complex and multifaceted operation require an army of dedicated corporate officials, but legions of executives from every corporation involved in space industrial activity are present. The PKN Interstellar consortium has made available an executive suit pattern that celebrates the Jita 4-4 expansion and marks the wearer as a member of Jita 4-4's corporate class.",
