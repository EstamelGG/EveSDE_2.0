  "description": "Extraction and processing of radioactive materials for use in industry can be difficult and hazardous work at best, with many standard mining techniques often treating such materials as waste byproducts that are better disposed of in space. Always on the look out for ways to increase the profitability of their mining and materials harvesting operations, ORE has established a specialist Radioactives Reclamation unit, equipped with dedicated harvesting and transport ships, to exploit dangerous and difficult to work radioactive materials.\n\nRadioactives Reclamation Specialists are easily recognised by the vivid \"radioactive green\" highlighting on the otherwise standard blue and grey of their survey suits. The suits themselves incorporate a repulsion field designed to block any radiation, particles or loose dust given off by the materials the wearer may be handling in the course of their work.",
