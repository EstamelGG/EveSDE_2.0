  "name": "Large Crate of Portable Emergency Heating Units",
  "description": "These heating units are compact, and light enough to carry in one hand. Each comes with two 10-hour rechargeable batteries, to be used one at a time while the spare charges. The amount of energy one unit puts off would be enough to warm a space of 20 cubic meters, roughly the interior space of a stationside apartment's main room, to an average of 10 degrees Celsius. Not particularly cosy, but better than freezing.",
