  "name": "Amarr Religious Mask",
  "description": "Masks have an important role in Amarr society due to their association with God's angelic servants, the sefrim, who wore them so that the people of Amarr would not be struck dead by their great beauty. Plain silver and gold sefrim masks are commonly used in Amarr religious ceremonies to invoke God. Donning a sefrim mask symbolizes the priest's role as an agent of God, investing them with the power and authority to perform their religious duties.\n\nOutside of ritual, masks are also used as a form of Amarrian heraldry. These masks, decorated with specific colors and iconography according to a strict set of rules, represent Amarrian noble houses, and they are frequently worn at high society affairs.\n\nPerhaps most in keeping with their original references in Scripture, though, Amarrian masks are sometimes used to hide great beauty or disfigurement in places where it might cause agitation. Some have also noted that masks feature extensively in the rites of extremist cults, such as the Sani Sabik and Equilibrium of Mankind, and a number of designs are listed as heretical in the Theology Council's monumental, multi-volume and highly restricted Codex of Forbidden Iconography and Symbols.",
