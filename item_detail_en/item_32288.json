  "description": "A tattered document, presumably a part of a larger manuscript. The text is written neatly, though much of it is faded. An excerpt from this piece, titled “Chapter 37 – The Fire in Our Hearts” reads as follows:<br><br>\n“Lord Arkon Ardishapur, though a longtime friend of Arzad, oversaw the popular Holder's execution for treason and blasphemy. Arzad had requisitioned an Amarr symbol of authority, a scepter,  as a symbol for lowly slaves. Arzad's granted the scepter to his slaves as a symbol for enlightenment and salvation. Ardishapur ordered that all copies of this scepter – dubbed Wildfire scepters for its blood obsidian orb, a rock native to Starkman Prime – be destroyed. The Starkmanir were angry at his execution. Arzad's book of sermons inspired the troubled tribe. <br><br>\n“Three months after his death, Arzad appeared to Drupar Maak while the slave was alone in the fields. The Starkmanir youth was afraid at first, though once he saw the shimmering eyes of his former Holder, he was at peace. Arzad handed a Wildfire scepter to Maak, telling him, ‘The fire in our hearts burns for salvation, redemption, and grace. May the Word of God grant you the courage to save yourself and your people.' With those words, Arzad disappeared, but the scepter was still with Maak. Years later, he would wield a similar item and avenge the death of his beloved Holder on the day of Khu-arzad. After that day, the scepter would be forever known as Khumaak.”",
