  "description": "Military service with the Minmatar Republic can take many forms and a Matari's service can be marked by a style of military tattoo that may incorporate specific tribal iconography. Much of the Vherokior Tribe's tattoo culture was preserved by the Vherokior shamans who also safeguarded the mysteries of the Voluval Ritual during the Amarr Occupation. While the structure of Vherokior tribal culture is notably different in many respects to other tribes, for example in the greater emphasis on matriarchal family units than large clans, they are a founder tribe of the Minmatar Republic. Therefore it is not unusual to see eligible Vherokior wearing their specific tribal variation of Republic service tattoos.\n\nThe Vherokior have a long history as a nomadic tribe but in the Republic era have transitioned to a culture that is marked more by its ubiquity in Minmatar territories as a widely-diffused diaspora based on the family unit. The cultural identity as Vherokior remains vitally important and aspects of the older, deeper ways continue to be upheld, with some choosing to take the path of the shamanic tradition. More common is the temporary nomadism of youth that leads many to take up an itinerant lifestyle for a time. Quite a large number of Vherokior channel the nomadic impulse into a life in service with the Republic Fleet, although many tend to retire early and settle into a life of running small businesses or living in co-operative circles.",
