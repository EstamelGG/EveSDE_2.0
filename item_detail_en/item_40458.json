  "description": "The challenges of maintaining biosecurity against infectious pathogens and other disease vectors in space-based infrastructure are multiplied by the cosmopolition and highly-interconnected nature of New Eden's space industry and trade networks. This long-recognised problem was for many decades dealt with by the empires, nations and corporations of New Eden in a rather piecemeal fashion, with disputes over jurisdiction and differing standards commonly arising.\n\nFollowing the Kyonoke Crisis of YC119, and the passage of the interstellar \"Hope for All Act\", CONCORD established a Biosecurity Response Team and began to build up its capacity and expertise in the fields of epidemiology and disease management. To that end CONCORD Biosecurity Response Team reached out to partners such as the University of Caille's Department of Epidemiology, Hedion University's School of Medicine, the Sisters of EVE, and the Society of Conscious Thought.\n\nCONCORD Biosecurity Responders are now available to be dispatched on emergency call to any space stations, orbital infrastructure or other space-industrial locations in response to disease and pathogen outbreaks of all kinds.",
