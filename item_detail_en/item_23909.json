  "description": "The Komni corporation was founded by the multi-billionaire Kaimo Nayen, who had garnered his fortune by building up a real estate empire on Caldari Prime.  The purpose of the company was to give his firstborn son, Shojin Nayen, a chance to receive experience as a CEO, before the time came for him to take over the reigns of his father's mega-corporation.  Komni dealt in simple garbage hauling tasks, employing a few dozen washed up pilots to do the sordid task of transporting unrecyclable material to remote locations within the Caldari solarsystems.<br><br>Unfortunately Shojin had been inexcusably spoiled as a child, and lacked all of his fathers virtues which had helped him become so successful.  The Komni corporation quickly began losing money, bad deals were made and the daily affairs were generally ignored by Shojin who spent most of his time dating beautiful women and staying out late at night at popular Caldari bars.  But when his father learned of the state of things, and that the Komni corporation had slid to the verge of bankruptcy, he became furious.  He demanded that his son straighten things out, or all of his shares within the mega-real-estate corporation would go to his other son, Akimo.<br><br>Shojin became terrified at these grim tidings, and was especially worried that his father would also strip him of access to his bank account which he so much relied on to live his extravagant lifestyle.  So he turned to the underworld for aid, secretly contacting an agent employed by the Guristas Pirates, Drako Minai, to manage his corporate affairs.  At first this worked out perfectly, the Komni stock rose considerably and money came streaming in.  Better pilots and maintainance on the old company haulers were finally affordable, without any intervention from Kaimo.",
