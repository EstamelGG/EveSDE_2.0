  "description": "On January 26th 2010 <url=showinfo:2//1000125>CONCORD</url> collected ISK from capsuleer alliances claiming territory in null security space. While most alliances received the reminder to pay their bills certain alliances either chose to ignore it or claimed to have never gotten the reminder.\n\nDue to these lost reminders and the subsequent failure to pay by several alliances <loc><url=showinfo:2//1000125>CONCORD</url> revoked their territorial claim on multiple solar systems. Several alliances were affected by this including <url=showinfo:16159//1899990246>Wildly Inappropriate.</url>, <url=showinfo:16159//1411711376>Legion of xXDEATHXx</url>, and most notably <url=showinfo:16159//824518128>GoonSwarm</url>. For both <url=showinfo:16159//1899990246>Wildly Inappropriate.</url> and <url=showinfo:16159//1411711376>Legion of xXDEATHXx</url> the response was simply to pay the bills and reclaim the solar systems. <url=showinfo:16159//824518128>GoonSwarm</url> however was in the middle of a war with <url=showinfo:16159//878776074>IT Alliance</url> over the ownership of <url=showinfo:3//10000060>Delve</url>.\n\n<url=showinfo:16159//878776074>IT Alliance</url> used <url=showinfo:16159//824518128>GoonSwarm's</url> failure to pay as an opportunity to conquer key systems including what many considered to be the core system of Delve, <url=showinfo:5//30004712>NOL-M9</url>.",
