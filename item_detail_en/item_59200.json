  "description": "Military service with the Minmatar Republic can take many forms and a Matari's service can be marked by a style of military tattoo that may incorporate specific tribal iconography. Thukker Tribe tattoo culture is far looser than most other tribes, with many Thukker even omitting the Voluval Ritual from their personal journey within Minmatar culture. While the other tribes regard the Thukker as eccentric in this regard they respect the cultural mores of their fellow Minmatar. Those Thukker who do wear tattoos may chose to display the specific Thukker variation of Republic service tattoos if eligible.\n\nWhile most Thukker live and work aboard  the nomadic Great Caravans, offshoot caravans, and stations and outposts in the Great Wildlands, many live in the Republic proper and some enter service with military and paramilitary branches like the Republic Fleet, Republic Security Services, or Republic Justice Department. The rare Thukker pilots and scouts who enter Republic service from caravan life are in particularly high demand for their skills.",
