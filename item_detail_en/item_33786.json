  "description": "The overall design of these 'Rider' pants - including the pleated fold at the front of the slim legs, the reflective edges that contrast precious gold with pure white, and the thin belt lacing at the top - clearly indicates that the wearer is of a high class indeed. \n\nAt the same time they are a perfect fit for a body that is never less than fresh out of the darkness of its pod, or the cleansing waters of its clone vats, and that is unhesitant to put its own life on the line whenever needed. Death, however often it visits, should not be any reason to allow oneself a slip in the high standards of style.",
