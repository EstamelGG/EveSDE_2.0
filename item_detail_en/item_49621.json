  "description": "Chromodynamic Tricarboxyls may be unstable but they have many uses, including use as a catalyzing material in synaptic acceleration implants and boosters.  A darker use is the refinement of the strange material into \"Deathglow\", a deeply mind-altering illegal booster that has recently found its way into the underground markets of New Eden.\n\nThis particular batch of Deathglow is top grade stuff and likely was intended for shipment to the Gallente black market in exotic boosters. Or perhaps it was ordered by a Vherokior shaman keen to try a new method of contacting the world spirits? The Deathglow Hunters don't seem to keep customer records around.",
