  "name": "Women's 'Olympian TorsoRig' Body Augmentation",
  "description": "Developed by Duvolle Laboratories under license from Wiyrkomi’s Industrial Biomechanics, this TorsoRig augmentation is a cutting-edge iteration on existing designs. The Olympian offers the same powerful enhancement of upper body strength, speed, and precision as previous models, but also features several improvements. The most obvious of these is the anti-tarnish gold-plated finish, but others include self-lubricating bearings for whisper-quiet movement and predictive-memory servos that anticipate actions based on past movements. The result is a more responsive, luxurious feel that adds prestige to the TorsoRig’s power.\n\nThe science and technology of enhancing biomechanics using cybernetic rigs and meshes is advancing all the time with much effort focused on lowering the barrier of entry in terms of manufacturing and resources that make up the cost of such powerful augmentations.",
