  "description": "This translucent cyan decoration was created for lightweight comfort. As part of its design it covers only part of the head, all the better to indicate a debonair look for the most fashionable (and, truth be told, richest and most powerful) individuals in the cluster. It is the kind of headgear that might be taken into sports, into high-speed traffic, or simply into a meeting of high-powered executives, where its casual style makes it very apparent who's boss.",
