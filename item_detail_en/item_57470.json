  "description": "Ultradian-Cycling Trigger Neurolink Conduits are vital components in the network of connections linking the neural hardware of a capsuleer to the many key systems of a spaceship.\n\nWhile all capsuleer neurolink technologies rely on the autonomic biosystems of pilots, Amarr research and development focused in particular on low frequency ultradian rhythms of sleep-cycles to establish a reliable integration of neurolink with ship systems.",
