  "description": "An electronic device that generates and amplifies a carrier wave, modulates it with a meaningful signal derived from speech or other sources, and radiates the resulting signal from an antenna. The High-Tech prototype is almost immune to any type of de-scrambling devices, making the transmission more secure.",
