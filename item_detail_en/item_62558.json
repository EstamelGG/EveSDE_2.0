  "description": "Obsidian ochre, an extremely valuable member of the dark ochre family, was only first discovered a decade ago. The sleek black surface of this ore managed to reflect scanning waves, making obsidian ochre asteroids almost invisible. Advances in scanning technology revealed these beauties at last. This ore's 10% higher mineral yield makes it more than worth the effort required to find it.\n\nConsidered a worthless ore for years, dark ochre was ignored by most miners until improved reprocessing techniques managed to extract the huge amount of <a href=showinfo:37>Isogen</a> and <a href=showinfo:36>Mexallon</a> inside it. Dark ochre also contains useful amounts of <a href=showinfo:38>Nocxium</a>.\n\nThis material is compressed and a much more compact form of the original material.",
