  "description": "Unmistakably the voice of Sansha Kuvakei, this audio fragment captures a brief glimpse of a low-key speech he made over a century ago. Dating from the height of his fame, Kuvakei's speech is riddled with self-indulgent rhetoric and delusions of grandeur. As the speech's intensity reaches its peak, his final line “I am the answer” loops repeatedly for a few minutes before the process begins all over again.",
