  "name": "Golden Sabik Vial",
  "description": "These vials, commonly worn around the neck as a pendant, are an important religious item for Sani Sabik adherents, representing the personal development of the wearer's spirit in their journey to becoming an immortal savant. Golden Sabik vials come in a variety of designs, from simple shells to teardrops, hearts (stylized or realistic), or busts of important religious figures. Despite the name, most golden vials are merely gilded. Only the most extravagant are made out of real gold.\n\nIn most Sanist faiths, adherents are not permitted to wear golden vials until formally entering the faith through a blood gifting ceremony. This is a consensual act in many Sanist groups, but harder sects like the Sarikusans of the Blood Raiders may refuse to allow adherents to join the faith or wear vials until they have taken blood by force. Various adornments may be added to a worshipper's vial as they develop in their faith, or they may take to wearing multiple vials. The loss of a vial is considered a severe setback in a Sanist's spiritual journey, though a Sanist may gift a vial to others in certain circumstances.\n\nContrary to popular belief, most golden vials do not actually contain any blood. Blood, or a blood substitute, may still be rubbed on the vial during religious ceremonies, but it is usually washed off following the event. The blood raiders are an exception to this, and instead end their functions by anointing their vials with protective coatings of varnish to preserve any blood stains.",
