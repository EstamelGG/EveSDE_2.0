  "name": "Women's Republic Commander's Dress Jacket",
  "description": "High-ranking warriors of the Minmatar Republic Fleet are often involved in the political cut and thrust of the Tribal Republic, where their appearances at Tribal Council, Republic Parliament, and the institutions of republic and tribes require them to wear formal dress uniform. Ranking warriors of commander level and higher are also commonly posted to liaison and other political roles across the Minmatar Republic. The high status and power of the military within Minmatar society accords such officers a wide latitude but they must nevertheless regularly wear formal dress. While the Republic Fleet makes available a standard dress uniform, the unending variation possible due to circle, clan and tribal affiliations, layered on top of divisional and speciality distinctions, means that formal dress can differ considerably depending on person and context.\n\nThis smartly tailored dress jacket is intended to be worn with the Republic Commander's Dress Pants, and suitable shoes or boots, to complete the formal dress uniform.",
