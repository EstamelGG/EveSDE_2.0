  "description": "While selective molecular repulsion fields are highly effective in repelling airborne pathogens, the use of physical masks remains a standard protocol for Biosecurity Response Teams. While simple in form, the nanofilter layers in the material of these masks provide protection against pathogens that may be carried through personal molecular repulsion fields in one way or another.\n\nFollowing the Kyonoke Crisis of YC119, and the passage of the interstellar \"Hope for All Act\", CONCORD established a Biosecurity Response Team and began to build up its capacity and expertise in the fields of epidemiology and disease management. To that end CONCORD Biosecurity Response Team reached out to partners such as the University of Caille's Department of Epidemiology, Hedion University's School of Medicine, the Sisters of EVE, and the Society of Conscious Thought.\n\nCONCORD Biosecurity Responders are now available to be dispatched on emergency call to any space stations, orbital infrastructure or other space-industrial locations in response to disease and pathogen outbreaks of all kinds.",
