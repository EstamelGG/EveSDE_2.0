  "description": "Heavily damaged from the explosion of his vessel, Guristas Captain Onoki Ekala's private designs fail to offer any significant insights into what his brilliant mind is currently working toward. Careful analysis of the reconstructed diagrams reveals various bio-chemical refining array designs, but many crucial details are missing. Presumably this facility has something to do with the processing of cytoserocin, the material harvested from gas clouds as part of booster production. Without access to more information, the designs alone offer no real clue as to what Ekala is up to save for the obvious; producing Crash boosters.",
