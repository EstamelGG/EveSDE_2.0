  "description": "This aberrant data packet was recovered from a copy of the Mynos Drifter mind. Its corruption holds unique hallmarks of the Labyrinth Complex to which it was connected.\n\nWhile clearly synthetic rather than organic in origin, the data packet shows evidence of layered redundancy associated with a mind that has evolved or emerged from a simpler set of constructs.",
