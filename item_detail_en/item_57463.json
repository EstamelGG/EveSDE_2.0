  "description": "Isotropic Neofullerene Alpha-3 is an advanced material useful for biotechnology applications, particularly those involving genetic engineering and nanoscale medical procedures.\n\nThe ultra-precise molecular uniformity of Isotropic Neofullerenes allow them to be used for fine tooling and environments that are completely inert and non-reactive at the nanoscale. Different isotropic patterns are also used as masking identifiers that nanites are keyed to recognise and ignore.",
