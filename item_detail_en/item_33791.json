  "description": "Harkening back to the days where even the most experienced spacefarers needed protection from the bruising of the elements, this elegant, yet rough-and-tumble design shows that the wearer has seen their own share of action and is unquestionably ready for more. \n\nA bone-white nanofiber-laced harness locks in seamlessly on the front, while the starkly white sides are composed of thin but untearable material that's framed in pitch black and leads to pads covering major joints in the upper body. A capsuleer wearing this jacket is ready for a fight, both in and out of the pod.",
