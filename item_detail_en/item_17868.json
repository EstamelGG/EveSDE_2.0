  "description": "Golden Omber spurred one of the largest gold rushes in the early days of space faring, when isogen was the king of minerals. The 10% extra yield it offers over common Omber was all it took to make it the most sought after ore for a few years.\n\nOmber is a common ore that is still an excellent ore for novice miners as it has a sizeable portion of <a href=showinfo:37>Isogen</a>, as well as some <a href=showinfo:35>Pyerite</a>. A few trips of mining this and a novice is quick to rise in status.\n\nAvailable primarily in low security status and wormhole systems.",
