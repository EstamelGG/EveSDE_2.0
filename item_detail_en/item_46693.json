  "name": "Batch Compressed Pellucid Crokite",
  "description": "This extremely rare and valuable variant of crokite ore was recently discovered by ORE engineers during early field tests of new moon mining technology. Subsequent testing has confirmed that this ore produces 15% more minerals than standard crokite when reprocessed.\n\nCrokite is a very heavy ore that is always in high demand because it has the largest ratio of <a href=showinfo:38>Nocxium</a> and <a href=showinfo:36>Mexallon</a> for any ore in the known universe. Valuable deposits of <a href=showinfo:35>Pyerite</a> can also be found within this rare ore.\n\n<i>This material was compressed using an older process that compressed batches of raw materials into units using a set input quantity. Newer compression technology uses a more flexible one-to-one unit compression system.</i>",
