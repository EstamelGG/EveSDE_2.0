  "description": "Capsuleers were given independent licenses 17 years ago and the YC122 celebrations mark this latest anniversary of the start of the Capsuleer Age with the opening up of New Eden's frontiers by immortal space pilots.\n\nCapsuleer Day XVII is a moment of celebration for \"The Elite\" pilots even as the threat of invasion from the Triglavian Collective looms. CONCORD and the core empires of New Eden surely hope to persuade the ranks of independent capsuleers to join the struggle against the implacable and inscrutable foe.",
