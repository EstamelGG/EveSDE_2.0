  "description": "Recent developments in salvager technology have allowed a greater variety of ancient components to be recovered from the wrecks of Sleeper drones.\nInitial scans of this salvaged Synthetic Aperture Ladar Receiver indicate that it includes technology that might be able to find a home in the sensor equipment of capsuleer ships. Engineers across the cluster have begun attempting to reverse engineer the Sleeper techniques used in this component, with Minmatar researchers expressing particular interest.",
