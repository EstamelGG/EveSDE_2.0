  "description": "For the combination of rough-and-tumble flavor with the sleek, sexy lines of patent leather, nothing beats the 'Corsair' heels. High laces give it a tight, yet extremely comfortable fit, while the leather straps crisscrossing its form, complete with bold, elegant clasps, give it that slight air of piracy which everyone knows tends to adhere - thoroughly undeserved and unfairly, of course - to high-flying capsuleers.",
