  "description": "This collection of electronic devices represents the core of the computerized functionality behind the Sleeper weapons systems. An amalgam of advanced calibration and tracking devices, they are the driving force behind the frightening accuracy and efficiency of Sleeper armaments. \n\nThe subroutines have been coded into various devices which were then secreted away inside an ultra-hard metallofullerene alloy container. A small tear in the container's seal has exposed them to centuries of radiation however, leaving them barely functional.\n\nEven despite this, a skilled scientist could still possibly extract enough information to reverse engineer one.",
