  "description": "Ghalen is an old Achuran dish of ground meat mixed with chopped vegetables, wrapped in large green leaves and cooked in fat and oils. Each Ghalen pastry is usually the size of a man's fist, dripping with juice when one bites into it. It is served piping hot and is one of the few dishes of old that has not only retained its appeal, but become known throughout the world of New Eden.",
