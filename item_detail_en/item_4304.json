Project Theseus set out to map the Labyrinth, perform a survey of the site, identify any Takmahl artifacts present, and to aid in future projects investigating Takmahl culture in Araz. \n\nTeams of ships entered the Labyrinth to combat the “Minotaur” guardians within and explore the site. The result of those efforts was a three-dimensional map which reveals much about the shape of the Labyrinth, in addition to containing useful information about the types and quantities of Takmahl artifacts to be found there.  \n\n<i>This abstract relates to research undertaken by the Arek'Jaalan Project.</i>\n\n<i>Authorized for capsuleer dissemination under the CONCORD Freedom of Distribution Act (Alpha-One-Five), YC 113.11.4</i>\n\n<i>Further copies of this document can be obtained through the Arek'Jaalan administrative site, located in the <a href=showinfo:5//30003413>Eram</a> system.<i>",
