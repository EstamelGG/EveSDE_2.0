  "description": "Genetic Structure Repairers are a component in the safeguarding measures adopted by EDENCOM and the empires during the Triglavian Invasions. In the event of mutagenic attack or genetic tampering nanotech repair systems will actively respond.\n\nDue to the mastery of mutaplasmids and other biotechnology demonstrated by the Triglavians, the risk of subversion through genetic tampering or outright mutagenic warfare attacks led EDENCOM to mandate safeguards for capsuleers piloting the most powerful naval vessels.",
