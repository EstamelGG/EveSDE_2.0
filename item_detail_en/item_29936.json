  "description": "It appears as if the only thing designed to survive the explosion of Rayle Melania's vessel was his accounting log, perhaps so it could later be recovered by his Serpentis colleagues. Although heavily encrypted, fragments of data are decipherable. Even from what little is readable, it is clear that Melania handles the shifting of his narcotic goods personally.  According to one transaction log, he made almost 300 individual deliveries across seven regions of New Eden, all in the space of a single day.",
