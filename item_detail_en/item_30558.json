  "name": "Malfunctioning Thruster Sections",
  "description": "After millennia of exposure to space, these thruster sections have begun to wear significantly, offering only a limited example of their full functionality. The modular design of Sleeper propulsion systems is still observable however, and is notably similar to that of the empires, only deviating in a few interesting areas.\n\nA determined and lucky researcher could still successfully reverse engineer something useful from this, but they would certainly stand a better chance with a more functional design.",
