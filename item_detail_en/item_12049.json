  "description": "Slavers thrive in the lawless areas of the galaxy, and in the Amarrian territories which view the slave business as a legal profession. Some slavers are notorious for their brutality and lack of morals, and will attack remote settlements without hesitation to capture innocent victims to be sold on the black market. The Minmatar Republic has been especially keen on setting bounties on all slave traders, as they bear a deep resentment and hatred towards slavery.",
