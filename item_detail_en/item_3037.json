  "name": "Crate of Experimental ECM Hybrid Rounds",
  "description": "These modified tungsten hybrid rounds send out an ECM pulse through the hull of any ship they strike, momentarily baffling the ship's target-locking mechanisms and affording the formerly-targeted ship a few precious moments to gain an advantage or escape. Efforts are being made to develop this into purely friend-or-foe munitions, effectively counteracting the effects of enemy ECM, but adaptation of the missile-based tracking technology to hybrid shell systems has proven difficult.",
