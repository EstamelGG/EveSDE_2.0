  "description": "There doesn't appear to be any particular organization here. Dozens of identical copies of everything from period dramas to last week's boxing finals, in original cases. Nothing that would raise any eyebrows.<br><br>\nThe actual contents of the holoreels are far less innocuous. After a token menu page and a few minutes of whatever program the case displays, they switch to more interesting material. Entire corporate internal presentations clearly never intended for the public eye. Snoop footage of important officials talking and even exchanging money with known competitors. A series of compromising stills of a prominent politician.<br><br>\nThese will be worth a lot of money to someone.",
