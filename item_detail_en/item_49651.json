  "name": "Purgative Coffin",
  "description": "The Amarr once used this ancient torture device to interrogate and punish heretics like the Sani Sabik. It served the dual purpose of extracting confessions and body disposal. Upon death, numerous Sani preachers would be sealed in these airtight coffins and locked away to prevent practitioners from recovering bodies for ritual purposes.\n\nWhile the device is rarely, if ever used by the Amarr Empire these days, in typical Blood Raider fashion the Covenant now uses the examples in its possession on any Amarr priests or heretic hunters that fall into their hands.",
