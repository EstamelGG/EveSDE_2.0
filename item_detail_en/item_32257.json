They will, eventually. Don't doubt it. I almost wish Boufin sold us out to them in the end, they'd realize there is nothing of value to them there and screw off. But then I guess anything we value, they'll want to lord over us too. I've noticed a few people of theirs are assigned to me too.

I'm not completely trusting that she will let me handle things. She needs to keep up her public appearances in court, not go off meeting Gallentean historians in secret. Her career would be over in a second if we got made, and I'd have serious problems of my own. <br><br>She's growing increasingly frustrated though, so we may have to look into some kind of arrangement.
