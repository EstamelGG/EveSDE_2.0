  "name": "Women's 'Rocket' Dress (glossy black)",
  "description": "With its curved, sinuous lines and high black collar, the 'Rocket' dress is equally reminiscent of a rocket breaking through the atmosphere and a dagger piercing through skin. A single join snakes through the pitch-black front, overlaid with a fine shoulder brooch, and terminating in a short V-shaped edge, while the hands are covered in silver clasps overlaying a fine pair of black gloves.",
