  "description": "This Minmatar politician pleads his innocence whenever you look his way. He claims that he has been framed, that everything has been a complex scheme to discredit his family. His tattoos mark him as not as a Nefantar, but as one of the member tribes of the Republic. His body is heavily bruised, but whether the injuries are from the Amarr agents or the Minmatar guards is hard to tell. Perhaps only the Republic courts can decide his innocence.",
