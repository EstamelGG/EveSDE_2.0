  "description": "This extremely rare and valuable variant of hemorphite ore was recently discovered by ORE engineers during early field tests of new moon mining technology. Subsequent testing has confirmed that this ore produces 15% more minerals than standard hemorphite when reprocessed.\n\nWith a large portion of <a href=showinfo:38>Nocxium</a>, hemorphite is always a good find. It is common enough that even novice miners can expect to run into it. Hemorphite also has some amount of <a href=showinfo:37>Isogen</a>.\n\n<i>This material was compressed using an older process that compressed batches of raw materials into units using a set input quantity. Newer compression technology uses a more flexible one-to-one unit compression system.</i>",
