  "description": "Cilis Leglise's missing Lieutenant is barely conscious. His legs are no longer functional, and a great deal of his right arm has been removed, almost to the shoulder. Irichi said he's modified this man the same way he'd been modified by Cilis, but this is a bit extreme.<br><br>Kipo is obviously under heavy medication.
