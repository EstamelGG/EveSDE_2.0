  "description": "Recovered from amongst the debris of a Sleeper facility, this ancient device is almost entirely shut down. Just one of these items would normally hold countless nanoassemblers inside, offering a comprehensive view of the finer details in the Sleeper's defensive systems. Unfortunately, all of the assemblers inside this one have fused together, causing a terminal chain reaction inside the device.\n\nEven though it is only a shell of what it once used to be, with a bit of guesswork and luck, a skilled scientist might still be able to extract enough information to try and reverse engineer it.",
