  "description": "Issued by the Directive Enforcement Department, this penalty ticket was delivered to an unidentified capsuleer pilot who left his Erebus class titan adrift outside the DED Assembly Plant in Nalnifan. An unusual event, the ticket was issued when officers came to the realization that the vessel was too large to tow.\n\nRumor has it that the pilot in question was sighted on board the station’s medical deck the morning after a drunken late night visit to the station’s pleasure hub, wondering how it was humanly possible to have misplaced 2.4 million tons of starship.",
