  "description": "These pieces appear to all be some form of polyhedral from truncated pyramids that can be gripped in the hand to barrel-sized fullerene-faceted globes. Each is shaped as if in one complete piece from bluish or steely-gray material, all edges beveled and smoothed. When rapped with a knuckle, the pieces ring like a bell, but the material feels more like ceramic.<br><br>\nEvery item bears a sort of dim, inner glow that pulses irregularly, like a dying light bulb. A tingle like electricity can be felt just above their surfaces, though preliminary examinations have dismissed the presence of any electrical activity. Each piece fits face to face with another piece; when linked correctly, they form series of twisted fractal-like branches.",
