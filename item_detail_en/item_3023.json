  "description": "This looks like little more than half a starship modified into ground-based living quarters. Several panels are inscribed with decorative symbols. A series of large rectangular cases contain corroded circuit boards with rows of finger-sized crystalline vials anchored to one face; some of the vials are still intact and contain a foggy gaseous substance. A section from what appears to have been a hydroponics lab contains trays of organic matter, fossilised from exposure to the moon's arid conditions and thin, nitrogen-argon atmosphere.",
