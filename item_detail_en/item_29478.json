  "description": "An ancient board game said to have been devised by the Ni-Kunni, this game was reputedly used for anything from entertainment on long ship hauls to deciding the fates of battles. Pieces in ancient times were made of wood or bone, but now most often consist of polymer compounds cast into intricate shapes. The game is easy to learn, hard to master, and really stupid to bet on.",
