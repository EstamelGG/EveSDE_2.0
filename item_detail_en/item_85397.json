  "name": "Small Mutaplasmid Residue",
  "description": "This is a dormant mutaplasmid residue extracted by reprocessing a piece of equipment bioadapted with a specialized mutaplasmid colony. This substance is not immediately capable of technology mutation without being integrated in a bioadaptive tool. However, it should provide useful starter material for the development of an active mutaplasmid colony suitable for use in bioadaptive technology.\n\nTriglavian bioadaptive technology makes extensive use of engineered colonies of extremophilic bacteria, that are used to grow, harvest and adapt various resources found in Abyssal Deadspace. Artificial colonizing plasmids integrated into specialist tools used for direct adaptation of technology can be found in Triglavian caches in various stages of development. These mutaplasmids can be used to alter the characteristics of a wide variety of equipment types, depending on the strain and the bioadaptive tool with which they are integrated.",
