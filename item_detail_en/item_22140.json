  "description": "The Tri-Vitoc is an offshoot of the infamous Vitoc drug used by the Amarrians to control their most precious slaves. Yet, Tri-Vitoc is not an Amarrian design, but a Gallentean one, a futile attempt at developing an antidote for Vitoc. Tri-Vitoc has much the same effects as normal Vitoc, but is also known to heighten the senses, even to the point of causing hallucinations.",
