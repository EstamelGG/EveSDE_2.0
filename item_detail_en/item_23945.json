  "description": "But soon the old man became suspicious.  He couldn't believe the incredibly good fortune his son was suddenly blessed with was simply due to hard, honest work.  So he hired an expensive private detective, Asamura, to investigate the internal affairs within Komni, to better understand exactly what had changed since disaster loomed over the corporation.  Asamura, being an ex-elite agent within the Caldari State special forces, quickly discovered who was behind this turn of events; that the Guristas had been using the garbage haulers as a means to smuggle drugs and other illegal goods into Caldari high security space for enormous profits.  Due to Kaimos's close relationship with many members of the Caldari State government, the garbage haulers received far less attention from local security forces than other, more suspcious craft.<br><br>When Kaimo heard of these tidings he became furious. If the news surfaced about Komni being under the influence of the Guristas Pirates and committing illegal acts within the Caldari State borders, his status and even his life might be forfeit.  He immediately confronted his son and ordered him to cut all ties with the Guristas, as well as letting him know that he had just blown any chance he had of acquiring the family fortune.  But there was one single flaw in Kaimos plan, and that was his underestimating of his sons determination to remain wealthy.  Threatening to expose Komnis illegal dealings to the media, Shojin played the only card he had.  Either his father leave his corporation alone and give it a large credit \"donation\", or both of their reputations would be ruined.  In return Shojin would severe all ties with the Guristas.  His father reluctantly accepted his sons terms.<br><br>Shortly thereafter Shojin held a secret meeting with his contact within the Guristas.  He demanded that Drako stop the illegal activity the Guristas had been conducting behind his back, and remove all ties they had with Komni.  But the wry, finely dressed agent simply laughed, they had played Shojin for a fool all along.  While Shojin had been endulging himself with the finer things in life, Drako had been busily hoarding the company stocks in preparation for a takeover.  He knew about Asamuras involvement, and expected this very conversation.  As Shojin looked in horror, two burly, brown-skinned men entered the room where he stood next to Drako.  With a simple move of his right hand, Drako ordered his guards to execute his unfortunate client.  And as he left the room, followed by high-pitched screams which were quickly silenced, the smiling, middle-aged man dressed in a shiny black tuxedo thought of how happy he was that the Komni stock had risen drastically upon the news of the takeover.  No longer would he need to answer to his less-than-trustworthy superiors within the Guristas, from this day forward he would own his very own branch within the vast Caldari criminal network.",
