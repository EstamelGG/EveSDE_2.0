  "name": "Intaki Spiced Tea",
  "description": "Intaki tea uses spices from their tropical homeworld, and is milky, with a very high amount of sugar. It is served in small cups, and its extremely sweet taste makes it a somewhat distinctive beverage. Traditionally, the milk of the Intaki pygmy water buffalo is used but it is not required. The drink's milky, sticky qualities combined with the special spices give it a unique status amongst other forms of tea.",
