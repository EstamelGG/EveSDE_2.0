At the center of the token is digital ID paired with a series of suspended entangled electrons. When the token is redeemed, the entangled electrons are engaged, altering their partners located at an off-site bank. Not only does this ensure the exchange occurs instantly, but when combined with a proprietary security shell it renders attempts to tamper or counterfeit the token useless.<br><br>Though the gold and silver case is merely an aesthetic addition, the coin-like appearance has become synonymous with the device, leading to nicknames of \"gold aurum\", or \"golden token\".<br><i>Source: SCOPE fluff piece (unprinted)</i>",
