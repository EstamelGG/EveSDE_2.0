  "description": "The corpse of an apparent Guristas agent recovered from the debris of a capsule intercepted and destroyed while trying to escape from Caldari State forces. The hijacked capsule appears to have been rigged to burn out every implant in the pilot's clone, going beyond even the damage a standard transneural echo scan would do to the occupant's gelbrain. Even so, expert forensic investigators may be able to make something out of this scorched and frozen hunk of synthetic flesh and disrupted nanotechnology.",
