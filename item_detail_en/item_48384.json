  "name": "Men's Triglavian Survival Suit (Svarog)",
  "description": "This Triglavian survival suit is marked with the symbol of the Triglavian grouping called the \"Svarog Clade\". CONCORD intelligence has established few hard facts about any of the clades but they are clearly major subdivisions within Triglavian society. The Svarog Clade exhibits signs of specialization in combat vessel construction, the development of novel weapon systems and extensive use of bioadaptive mutaplasmid technology. \n\nAnalysts also claim that the Svarog Clade seems the most aggressive and traditional, although there are indications this clade is open to exploring new opportunities and will exploit them ruthlessly. This Triglavian survival suit was probably sourced from the black market and care should be taken to ensure that the bioadaptive technology typically found in such items has been deactivated and removed.",
