  "description": "This reliquary supposedly contains the aged and withered middle finger of the long-dead St. Tetrimon. Despite a number of conflicting stories as to the fate of St. Tetrimon's remains, this is most definitely a fake. A Ministry of Internal Order raid on the marketplace where this reliquary was for sale uncovered fifteen boxes each containing a dozen identical right-hand middle fingerbone relics, all labelled as supposedly from the same saint.",
