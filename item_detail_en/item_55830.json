  "name": "Triglavian Sublight Telemeter",
  "description": "This device was recovered from the wreck of a Triglavian Collective invasion vessel and appears to use sublight sensing and communications technology. The presence of a substantial data storage buffer indicates it is used to collect and transmit data from the immediate surroundings of the ship. The Sublight Telemeter is presumably useful for surveillance and data collection in local space.\n\nEDENCOM Intelligence is keen to acquire these devices and assess their integrated storage so as to evaluate Triglavian movements and activities. The DED is collecting the items on behalf of EDENCOM in exchange for technology sanctioned for release to anti-Triglavian capsuleers through its loyalty store.",
