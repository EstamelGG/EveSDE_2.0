  "description": "Only the highly advanced Ukomi superconductor can be rendered small enough for use in nano-factories, microscopic devices programmed to absorb and recycle ambient material into useful matter. Each factory is built from reactive metals, ensuring that they interact properly – or not at all – with their environment, while a mote of industrial explosive automatically destroys them when they have completed their task.",
