  "description": "The multimedia giant Impetus exerts creative domination over the Gallente holo industry, but in the time before the Gallente Federation was even a dream in the minds of the elite, it was a simple children's trading card venture.\n\nAfter first contact with the Caldari, Impetus was catapulted to commercial success because of those very same card games, which had a unique appeal to the competitive culture. The deep strategies and mechanics provided a fresh challenge for the gaming-obsessed Caldari, and the formerly struggling Impetus saw its fortunes skyrocket.",
