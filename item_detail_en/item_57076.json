  "name": "Men's Yoiul Stormchasers Suit",
  "description": "This Yoiul Stormchasers Suit is especially configured for heavy-duty service aboard ice extraction vessels and facilities, and marks the wearer as a member of advanced resource extraction teams chasing riches among ice storms during the Yoiul Festival period.\n\nThe appearance of Metaliminal Volatile Ice Storms across New Eden, and the rich resource fields they bring in their wake, has led many to chase the storms in search of useful ice ores or that lucky strike of some especially valuable salvage trapped in the ice.\n\nWith the volatile ice storms sweeping across New Eden during the YC122-123 Yoiul Festival, ORE and its Frostline Laboratories division have taken the opportunity to promote their advanced resource extraction technologies using the Yoiul Festival as a backdrop. The Yoiul Stormchasers line of clothing is designed for the rigors of work in the depths of the ice storms and aboard resource extraction ships and rigs.",
