  "description": "Caldari corporations often retain the services of troubleshooters willing to operate at the edges of civilization and the law. Licensed corporate troubleshooters can often be identified by the modified exploration suits many have taken to wearing in the field.\n\nSeeing an opportunity in the market for variable atmosphere and gravity exploration gear, the Impro corporation developed its 'Impro-XS' integrated clothing and equipment line.
