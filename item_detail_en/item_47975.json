  "name": "Crystalline Isogen-10",
  "description": "This rare isotope of the mineral Isogen naturally forms stable bipyramidal crystals in the absence of the tremendous forces that typically form the more common crystal forms of Isogen, such as found in asteroids or moons. Crystalline Isogen-10 can form in space under the correct local conditions, typically requiring the abnormal gravitation fields that are found in unusual configurations of space-time topology like Abyssal Deadspace. \n\nIsogen-10 has been determined to be useful in the construction of light but strong materials suited to varying gravitational forces and associated accelerations. It is possible this form of Isogen could be broken down into other isotopes but they would likely be unstable, and such processes would run the risk of unleashing large quantities of energy.",
