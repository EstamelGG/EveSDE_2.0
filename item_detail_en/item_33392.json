  "description": "After their victory in the Fourth Alliance Tournament, <url=showinfo:16159//1399057309>HUN Reloaded</url> had struggled to return to the top tier of teams for years. By the Tenth Alliance Tournament many had begun to discount them as old news. They proved their stature as long-term Tournament heavyweights with a brilliant performance in ATX, riding a versatile core of <url=showinfo:28665>Vargur</url> Marauders with ever-shifting support to the finals, including a strategic outmaneuvering of <url=showinfo:16159//386292982>Pandemic Legion</url> in the semi-finals. They will be looking to improve on their Silver medal performance in YC 115â€™s ATXI and return to the pinnacle they once ruled.",
