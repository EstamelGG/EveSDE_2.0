  "description": "A single male White Song bird. The female seems to have died, perhaps due to the stress of recent events.\n\nThe White Song was once the symbol of the Achura's Imperial line. Only government buildings were allowed to keep White Songs in captivity. It was said that when the last White Song left the Royal Tower, the Achura Empire would die. The Achura Empire died first, but the White Song is still regarded with great reverence.",
