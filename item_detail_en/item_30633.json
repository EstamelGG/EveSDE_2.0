  "description": "This collection of electronic devices represents the core of the computerized functionality behind the Sleeper weapons systems. An amalgam of advanced calibration and tracking devices, they are the driving force behind the frightening accuracy and efficiency of Sleeper armaments. \n\nThe subroutines have been coded into various devices which were then stored inside the facility from which they came. Exposed to countless centuries of radiation after its walls began to erode, the subroutines are barely recognizable, offering only the most rudimentary glimpses into Sleeper weapons design. It would take a skilled researcher and a good amount of luck to successfully reverse engineer anything functional from such a broken mess.",
