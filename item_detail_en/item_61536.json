  "name": "Men's Paradoxical Scarf",
  "description": "A scarf that is almost ridiculously, comically long and seemingly patterned at random with bands of varying width and unusual color choices. The scarf is so long that it's unclear where it begins and where it ends. There's some paradox at work here but this unusual piece of clothing can be worn as a complete piece of outerwear, wrapping the wearer up in its warm and apparently unending coils.",
