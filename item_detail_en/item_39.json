  "description": "Only found in huge geodes; rocks on the outside with crystal-like quartz on the inside. The rarest and most precious of these geodes are those that contain the dark green zydrine within. Very rare and very expensive.\n\nMay be obtained by reprocessing <a href=showinfo:1223>bistot</a> ore and its variations which are available in null security status and wormhole systems.\n\nSignificant amounts of zydrine are also present in rare ores like <a href=showinfo:19>spodumain</a> and <a href=showinfo:52315>rakovene</a>.\n\nIt can be found in null security status star systems in <a href=showinfo:82163>hezorime</a>.\n\nThe rare ore <a href=showinfo:74529>eifyrium</a> also contains significant quantities and is found primarily in nullsec and W-space systems containing A0 (Blue Small) stars, as well as surveyed locations on the borders of empire and nullsec space.",
