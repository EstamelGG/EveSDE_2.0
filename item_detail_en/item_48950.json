  "description": "121.02.07 09:06.12\nTo: global.faction\n\nIt has come to my attention that many of you are understandably concerned about the potential for a repeat of last year's interruptions. I would like to assure everyone that we have taken every possible precaution to ensure the sanctity of the event. The Gala has an increased security complement and has been relocated to more discreet pockets of space. This year promises to be our most secure, and dare I say most fun, event ever.\n\nFor those of you whose fears have not been allayed, I offer you my personal guarantee that I will not allow for a repeat of last yearâ€™s debacle. I would also like to remind you of our standard biomass policy regarding dissent.\n\nYour grateful host, \n\nO.H",
