  "description": "On 3rd March YC106, a group of capsuleers united under the Zombie Inc corporation established a successful siege of one of the Yulai system's gates. At the time, Yulai was a key market hub and the siege caused a major disruption to the flow of trade. Standard CONCORD ships and sentry guns proved no match for the Zombie Inc fleet's remote repair capacity. The situation was resolved when the then active Jovian delegation to CONCORD intervened with their advanced technology.\n\nAfter this encounter, the CONCORD Inner Circle held an emergency meeting at which the Jovian delegation agreed to provide their technology for purposes of substantially upgrading the CONCORD fleet. To this day, the CONCORD fleet's core elements remain among the most powerful in New Eden.",
