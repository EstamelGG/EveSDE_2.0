  "description": "Printed on stark, no-nonsense graphene paper, this urgent application packet is stamped repeatedly with <i>PRIORITY OVERRIDE</i> sigils and more than one impatient annotation in red text. Intended for corporations seeking immediate refuge within a new alliance, the form demands everything at once: fleet readiness numbers, logistical capacity, diplomatic liabilities, outstanding grudges, and a sworn statement that <i>any fires currently burning are under control.</i>\n\nNear the bottom, a desperate handwritten note has been scribbled into the margin:\n<i>“Please approve quickly. Situation evolving. Assets mobile.”</i>\n\nFiling this document is often considered the first true loyalty test: if you can survive the paperwork, you can survive the alliance.",
