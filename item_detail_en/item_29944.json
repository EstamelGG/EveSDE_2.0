  "description": "Found drifting in a container amongst the wreckage of her ship, Guristas Captain Isoryn Ardorele's personal possessions tell a tale of devastating loss. Federation Navy medals rewarding long years of service, hand paintings made by her late daughter, a wedding ring â€“ all mementos of a past destroyed by Caldari thugs. With such a constant and effective reminder of her painful history, it is little wonder that Ardorele manages to sustain her murderous rage towards the Caldari.",
