  "description": "This collection of electronic devices represents the core of the computerized functionality behind the Sleeper weapons systems. An amalgam of advanced calibration and tracking devices, they are the driving force behind the frightening accuracy and efficiency of Sleeper armaments. \n\nThe subroutines have been coded into various devices which were then secreted away inside an ultra-hard metallofullerene alloy container. They show barely any sign of age, serving as an almost perfect example of Sleeper weapons design. \n\nPristine, working examples of Sleeper technology such as this are extremely rare and even more valuable. With the right skills and equipment, they can offer great insights into the scientific pursuits of the ancient race that designed them.",
