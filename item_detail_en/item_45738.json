  "description": "Upon transfer of Project Discovery to CONCORD, a new program of exoplanets hunting was embarked on by the citizen science platform. The Exoplanets Program Director Coat is patterned on the House of Ranai's 'Esquire' executive coat design and uses its famously smart yet comfortable resothane and spider-silk dual-layered fabric. \n\nIncorporating the Project Discovery Exoplanets Program logo, this stylish executive coat will mark out high achievers in the search for planets outside the bounds of human-explored space.",
