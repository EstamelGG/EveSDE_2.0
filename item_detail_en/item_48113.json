  "description": "<font color=\"#ff3399cc\"><b>+9% Armor Repair, +9% Shield Booster. Duration 30 minutes.</b></font>\n\nA novel and powerful addition to the range of neural boosters available to capsuleers, the Agency's ‘Hardshell’ compounds introduce a temporary but highly adaptive neural lace into the user’s synaptic structures. This 'Hardshell' lace attaches to synaptic pathways involved in fine-tuning field control at various energy levels, this allows an increase in shield booster efficiency and, through the low-energy fields that direct nano-repairers throughout a ship's armor layers, an increase in repair rates.\n\nCompounds with the Agency identifier are being seeded into target locations identified by the mysterious network ahead of sponsored operations. Entities occupying the target sites often collect the Agency's support drops themselves even if they realize what they must portend. The Agency’s novel method of supporting capsuleer operations is thought to be as much an experiment as it is an incentive for freelance pilots to take up the public contracts.",
