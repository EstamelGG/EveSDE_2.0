  "description": "This Abyssal Filament will pull  <b>up to two T1 Cruisers</b>  into a pocket of Abyssal Deadspace with an environment blasted by plasma firestorms that will <b>reduce Thermal resistance</b> but <b>enhance ship armor strength</b>.\n\nSOCT scientists have detected a substantial energy surge in this region of Abyssal Deadspace, pointing to a recent large-scale battle. Ongoing activity indicates the presence of several vessels. The SOCT calls upon capsuleers to deploy battle-fitted cruisers and investigate, with the goal of recovering valuable technology and data.\n\nAs the conduits are in collapse, space and time around them have become warped to the point of being insulated entirely. As a result, exiting the safe space via one side will appear like entering it from the other.\n\nThe pocket is categorized as 'very hard,' and the SOCT strongly advises that only veteran capsuleers, preferably in a fleet of two, should venture in.\n\n<b><color=yellow>Warning:</color></b> Abyssal Deadspace is a particularly harsh and unforgiving environment. After <b><color=yellow>30 minutes</color></b> catastrophic collapse of the warp field is predicted, with <b><color=yellow>destruction of the ship and capsule</color></b> certain.\n\nTriglavian Origin Conduits will permit the activating ship to return to normal space.",
