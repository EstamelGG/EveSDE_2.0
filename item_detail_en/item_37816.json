  "name": "Women's 'Rocket' Dress (festive)",
  "description": "With its curved, sinuous lines and high collar, the 'Rocket' dress is equally reminiscent of a rocket breaking through the atmosphere and a dagger piercing through skin. A new festive release features a single join through the maroon patterened front, overlaid with a fine shoulder brooch, and terminating in a short V-shaped edge, while the hands are covered in gold clasps overlaying a fine pair of bronze gloves.",
