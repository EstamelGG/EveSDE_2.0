  "description": "These navigation logs recovered from a Guristas Pirates ship could provide vital intelligence as to the location of hidden pirate bases and supply caches in the contested Caldari-Gallente Warzone. Unfortunately, the logs appear to have been almost completely destroyed and what data remains is heavily encrypted, as such, only a specialized facility is likely to find any success in recovering any information of value from this.",
