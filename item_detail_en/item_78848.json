  "name": "Encrypted Upwell Consortium Data Cache",
  "description": "This data cache recovered from an Upwell Consortium ship could be host to a whole trove of valuable information that would be of interest to the Angel Cartel and Guristas Pirates. Such examples are corporate investment plans, security briefings, corporate bearer bonds, local currency, asteroid surveys and prototype blueprints.\n\nThe device is damaged and the data in fragmentary form. Hundreds, if not thousands, of sequences would be required to break the code, as such, only a specialized facility is likely to find any value or success in analyzing this object.\n\nThe Angel Cartel and Guristas Pirates will reward capsuleers who bring this item to their laundering centers.",
