  "description": "Despite the best efforts of the core empires' defense forces and EDENCOM regulars, the New Eden Common Defense Initiative has been reliant on capsuleers to tilt the scales in favor of military forces defending systems from Triglavian invasion. This beret is a mark of the reliance of EDENCOM on capsuleers providing critical support in star systems under Triglavian assault and can be worn with pride by any capsuleer assisting EDENCOM.\n\nThis beret has been awarded on behalf of Provost Marshal Kasiha Valkanir and is part of a matched set with the EDENCOM 'Reliant' T-shirt, the latter being made available to those capsuleers offering sustained support to EDENCOM.",
