  "name": "Men's Imperial Commander's Dress Pants",
  "description": "Senior officers of the Amarr Imperial Navy are a common sight at the Imperial Court, the courts of Royal Houses, or even at the courts of major and minor houses of the Empire, where they must wear formal dress uniform at a minimum. The commander level ranks and above are also called upon to serve in various capacities throughout the vast military and civil bureaucracies of the Amarr Empire, again wearing their formal dress uniforms on a regular basis. In the prestige and ritual dominated Amarr Empire, the formal dress uniform is merely the most common variation, and far more ornamented and baroque levels of dress can be seen according to rank, occasion and place.\n\nThese smartly tailored dress pants are intended to be worn with the Imperial Commander's Dress Jacket, and suitable shoes or boots, to complete the formal dress uniform.",
