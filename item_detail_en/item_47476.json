  "description": "Display your attendance at the SoCT's annual capsuleer gathering with this specially customized exploration suit. In the 15th anniversary year of the dawn of the Capsuleer Age, the SoCT chose to host the gathering at its new diplomatic facility, across the bay from Concord City, on the surface of Yulai III.\n\nThe Society of Conscious Thought encourages graduates of its elite education programs to network with one another and has established many cohorts of former students throughout New Eden. As the SoCT takes a somewhat tutelary view of capsuleers as a class, the Society also encourages movers and shakers among the capsuleers to network with one another for the advancement of humanity in New Eden.",
