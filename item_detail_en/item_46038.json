  "description": "The Independent Gaming Commission is always on the look out for interesting locations where it might hold its combat tournaments or set up some of its popular casinos and gaming centers. Location scouts travel far and wide across New Eden, searching for suitable arena locations and seeking out breathtaking vistas that might add to the attraction of their gaming sites for high-rolling tourists.\n\nSeeing an opportunity in the market for variable atmosphere and gravity exploration gear, the Impro corporation developed its 'Impro-XS' integrated clothing and equipment line. The gear's superior environmental adaptation technology resulted in a rapid take up from various corporations across New Eden.",
