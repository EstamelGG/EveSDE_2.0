  "name": "Corporate Assassin",
  "description": "An elite corporate assassin, whose services are available usually only to the wealthiest and most discreet clientele. His track record of killings reaches far beyond Caldari space, with known “hits” recorded as far away as the Amarr and Gallente homeworlds. His weapon of choice is a highly-modified laser sniper rifle that he has proven effective at ranges up to and including three kilometers. Of course, he also utilizes a variety of other weapons, particularly for close range work. These include untraceable poisons, obscure neurotoxins, and, a variety of small arms and knives all, again, highly customized. He has a unblemished kill record, with no known failures, over a period of at least the last 20 years. When ultra-wealthy corporate executives require a more direct response to individuals who threaten their company's profitability, this is one of the few contract killers than can actually be trusted not only to accomplish the most difficult missions, but also to keep any such business dealings to himself. In short, he knows how to keep his mouth shut. These factors make him a highly desirable contractor for tasks requiring his unique skill set.",
