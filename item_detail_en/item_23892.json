  "description": "On the other side of the fence, the Minmatar Republic has been flooding Audesder with its own troops.  Desperate to prevent another Amarr occupation, it has poured all of its resources into creating an impregnable defensive barrier between it and the Ammatar.  The Gallente Federation and ORE have lent their support as well, the Federation sending an armada of ships to help defend Audesder incase of an attack, and ORE supplying the Minmatar forces with financial aid as well as hired mercenaries.  <br><br>  War looms over this troubled area, and analysts suspect that it may spread to outlying regions.  This could even be the start of a new galactic war that no one wants except the most fanatical nationalists.  CONCORD are monitoring the situation closely, and have reportedly been trying their hardest to soothe the political climate to prevent an all-out-war.  But even they cannot prevent the inevitable battle over Audesder, and we can only hope the conflict will not spread to the neighboring regions.",
