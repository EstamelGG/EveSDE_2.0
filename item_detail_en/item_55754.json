  "name": "Women's 'Republic Valklear' Beret",
  "description": "The Minmatar Republic's commitment to the cause of total liberation remains unwavering and has become a powerful rallying cry in the new era of the Tribal Republic. Many have responded to the call, and fight to defend the Republic and free their fellow Matari. As a result many new \"valklears\" – those who are tempered by war and have paid a blood price – have emerged among the ranks of Minmatar capsuleers.\n\nWarriors of the Republic's military and tribal militias are deeply motivated to liberate the vast numbers of Minmatar who are still held by the Amarr and other slavers. This beret displays your loyalty to the Minmatar Republic, its powerful symbolism signalling the wearer's commitment to liberate those Matari kin who live in bondage.",
