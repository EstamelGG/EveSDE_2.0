  "description": "Nothing in this file is decipherable, only the name. Serpentis could be using any one of a million different decryption methods. The good news is that a brute force attack could take as little as a few days, the bad news is that it could also take as long as a few decades. It all depends on how esoteric the cipher is, or if it's even a known, documented one. If it's a hybrid cipher, then it depends on how unique or distinctive both - assuming it's only two, of course - original parent ciphers were. A hybrid decryption analysis alone can take weeks, assuming that an original identifier for one single method is found.<br><br>It's probably best to just take this back to Isha.",
