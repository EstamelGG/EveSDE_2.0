  "name": "Batch Compressed Silvery Omber",
  "description": "Silvery Omber was first discovered some fifty years ago in an asteroid belt close to a large moon. The luminescence from the moon made this uncommon cousin of normal Omber seem silvery in appearance, hence the name. It is still considered a lucky find by miners across New Eden due to a roughly 5% improved mineral yield compared to standard omber.\n\nOmber is a common ore that is still an excellent ore for novice miners as it has a sizeable portion of <a href=showinfo:37>Isogen</a>, as well as some <a href=showinfo:35>Pyerite</a>. A few trips of mining this and a novice is quick to rise in status.\n\n<i>This material was compressed using an older process that compressed batches of raw materials into units using a set input quantity. Newer compression technology uses a more flexible one-to-one unit compression system.</i>",
