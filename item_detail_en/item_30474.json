  "description": "Nanowire composites function as connective links between subsystems. Graphene nanoribbons form the base of the components, carrying electrical power between other devices integrated into electromechanical hull sheets. A final coating of thermal diffusion film ensures efficient heat dispersion, allowing a starship captain to overload modules connected to subsystems without risking the entire vessel.",
