  "description": "Kept safe from the explosion of her vessel, this Holoreel collection is a meticulous document of Serpentis Lieutenant Elois Ottin's entire acting career. A large Impetus logo is emblazoned on the outside of the container, suggesting that perhaps the case was a gift from the corporation. Although Ottin rarely managed to snare contracts with Impetus to produce her works, they did manage and fund her two most successful acting ventures.
