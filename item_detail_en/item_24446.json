  "description": "Dorga are a species of saltwater fish indigenous to Munory VI. Due to the inhospitable conditions these fish have evolved in, their extremely resilient eggs are in high demand among spacefarers and others who require sustenance in unforgiving environments. While very nutritious, dorga roes possess a horribly bitter flavor, a fact which has hamstrung all marketing campaigns attempted for them so far.",
