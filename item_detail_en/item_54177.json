  "description": "CONCORD's Directive Enforcement Department is a significant reserve force that grew out of the original CONCORD Assembly Peacekeeping Army (CAPA). Known to most simply as the \"CONCORD Army\", CAPA's permanent command staff consists of career DED officers while most formations are drawn from the reserves of member states, primarily the \"Big 4\" core empires of New Eden.\n\nThe DED Army Reserve maintains a dedicated cryptology branch that includes a large number of specialists. As the CONCORD Army regularly deploys for peacekeeping and conflict monitoring into planetary and orbital theaters, Cryptologic Technicians rated for interpretation duties are essential. While the use of universal translators is widespread, it is still desirable to use language specialists for interpretation and analysis given the nuances of New Eden's large number of languages and dialects.",
