  "description": "This unusual, apparently decorative item is a small transparent dome-shaped object containing white flakes suspended in some kind of viscous liquid. Centered within the dome is a curious collection of miniature architectural models, presumably meant to represent a city or civilization or perhaps even some kind of homeworld. At the base of the globe sits an inscription: “They Who Dwell in the Shadows.”",
