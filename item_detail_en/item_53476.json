  "description": "The Subcranial Nanocontroller is an advanced component from Lai Dai intended for use in biomechanical and neurocybernetic implants in a similar fashion to the older Transcranial Controller technology owned and licensed by Ishukone. Implants using Subcranial Nanocontrollers are being marketed as cheaper, more flexible and less intrusive. Lai Dai is believed to have made some key breakthroughs in its development of this technology after acquiring medical research and technology in the course of asset recovery operations carried out by Lai Dai Protection Services.\n\nIt is believed that the Khanid Kingdom and Tash-Murkon Family are eager to incorporate the new technology in more advanced, efficient and pervasive slave control devices with the aim being the elimination of the Vitoc method of enforcing slavery obedience. Many believe the Vitoc method is fatally vulnerable to chemical and biological subversion vectors, and several attacks using Insorum and Deathglow to provoke slave uprisings have reinforced this view in the Amarr Empire. The future of the Subcranial Nanocontroller technology, and Lai Dai's profit margins looks bright as a consequence.",
