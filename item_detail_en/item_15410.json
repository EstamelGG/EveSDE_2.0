  "description": "This priceless mineral was discovered by a band of Gallente explorers during the Caldari-Gallente war over a century ago. Closely related to morphite, its composition is only slightly different yet enough so that it has not been able to serve the same function. Only a few samples of it are known to remain intact, in the possession of some of the most wealthy collectors in the known universe.",
