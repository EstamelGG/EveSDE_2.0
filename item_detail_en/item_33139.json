  "description": "This tag came from a pirate who had been negotiating combat contracts for pirate-trained clone soldiers.\n\nGiven the extraordinary dangers that result from clone soldiers, CONCORD has taken a firm stance against anyone involved with them, and will award a security status boost to the person who brings in these tags. They may be handed in at station Security Offices in low-security space.",
