  "description": "One of twenty-seven different cards created for the first ever New Eden Open tournament of YC 114. While not the first ever capsuleer tournament it was the first of its kind to be sponsored by a private media organization and broadcast to a much larger audience. It was also set a new benchmark for prizes in a capsuleer tournament.\n\nThe New Eden Open broke the tradition of previous capsuleer tournaments by allowing teams to form at will, without the need to be bound to the same alliance.\n\nThis card represents the following team and sponsor:\n<font color=\"0xff00CC00\">Team Name:</font> The Exiled Gaming\n<font color=\"0xff00CC00\">Sponsor Name:</font> No team sponsor.\n\n<font size=\"14\" color=\"0xff0099FF\"><b>Team Captain:</b></font>\n<url=showinfo:1377//1561889551>Imbor</url>\n\n<font size=\"14\" color=\"0xff0099FF\"><b>Team Members:</b></font>\n<url=showinfo:1377//2078455254>Antonius Lee</url>\n<url=showinfo:1377//1985608872>Arilyth</url>\n<url=showinfo:1377//91770769>Gabrielle Padecain</url>\n<url=showinfo:1377//1089210341>Sairuika</url>\n<url=showinfo:1377//1848470189>Sairuikon</url>\n<url=showinfo:1377//593142863>Zura zame</url>\n<url=showinfo:1377//1925809190>Zurazame</url>\n\n<i>Can you collect them all?</i>",
