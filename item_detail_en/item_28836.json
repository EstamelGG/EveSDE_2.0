  "description": "The letters of Bishop Dalamaid have been the subject of volumes of intellectual discourse. The primary contention of the letters, that true saintly martyrdom is an impossibility for anyone even aware of the concept of sainthood, has gone through various levels of favor over the generations. <br><br>\n\nLetters XIII through XV include a few juicy morsels about a prostitution ring that was run illegally from a monastery of one of the more prestigious orders in Dalamaid's time.",
