  "description": "The only known cure for the infamous Vitoc method that Amarrians use to control their massive slave contingents, Insorum is the answer to every loyal Minmatar's desire to see their people freed from its insidious grip. How Angel Lieutenant Kaura Triat even came into possession of such a rare and highly-valued Insorum sample is anyone's guess. More intriguing, however, is the fact that it seems to have been heavily modified by scientists, perhaps those working for Serpentis Inquest. Encased in a resilient tamper-proof case that will destroy the contents within if opened by anyone but its owner, this sample seems to have been integrated with the Sooth Sayer booster. What purpose this process might have served remains entirely unclear.",
