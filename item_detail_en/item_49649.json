  "description": "Sani Sabik sects are found throughout New Eden, many with significantly different belief systems from that of the Blood Raider Covenant's Sarikusan sect. When compared to the Covenant, Sani Sabik worshippers found in places like the Federation can be considerably softer, exchanging blood freely with other worshippers instead of forcibly bleeding captives. Sanist worship in the Federation has risen steadily over the last decade, with many attributing its growing popularity to the famous music star, Midna Lyre, who produces Sani Sabik-themed music.\n\nLifeblood was Midna Lyre's breakout album into the genre of Sanist music, which had until then only been found in amateur music produced for Galnet media sites and Sanist subgroups. The controversy surrounding the album secured Midna the number one spot on Egonics' Top Albums of YC110 list, with singles like, \"Night Box,\" and \"I Wanna Taste You (Bleed for Me)\". Midna has gone on to produce many more Sani Sabik-themed songs, and a compilation album of her greatest hits titled, \"The Red Album,\" is due for release in mid YC121.\n\nSeveral attempts have been made to ban sales of Lifeblood and other Sani Sabik music. This activism has not seen much success in the Federation, but in the Amarr Empire possession of Sanist music, including anything produced by Midna (Sani Sabik or not), is grounds for arrest and charges of heresy.",
