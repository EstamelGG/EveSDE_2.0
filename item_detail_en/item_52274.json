  "description": "In YC109, a number of sealed stargates reactivated, opening the way to an isolated group of eight regions in the New Eden cluster's north-west. Exploration of these regions by capsuleers swiftly revealed them to be infested with rogue drones and the sub-cluster of systems came to be known as the \"Drone Regions\" by the general population.\n\nAn official CONCORD naming committee took suggestions from capsuleer explorers for official names for the regions, which had previously been assigned alphanumeric designations. The result of the consultation was the renaming of the eight regions as follows:\n\nH3J8-U – Cobalt Edge\n6HL8-L – Outer Passage\nVU-WU2 – The Spire\n7-KXBJ – Etherium Reach\n87-1CW – Kalevala Expanse\nLQ-OQN – Malpais\nS-I6VU – Perrigen Falls\nG5KW-3 – Oasa",
