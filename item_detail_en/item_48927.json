  "name": "Chromodynamic Tricarboxyls",
  "description": "A chemical flux in strangely distorted mineral form produced by the subtle, yet profound effects of the intermediate deadspace environment, chromodynamic tricarboxyls are principally obtained by mining and reprocessing certain rare ores to be found in deadspace, such as the weirdly glowing cthonic attar and amethystic crystallite asteroids. \n\nWith increasing interest in the useful properties of these compounds, other sources have been discovered, typically in extreme or isolated space environments where gravitational effects may vary unpredictably.\n\nChromodynamic tricarboxyls may be unstable but they have many uses, including use as a catalyzing material in synaptic acceleration implants and boosters. A darker use is the refinement of the strange material into \"Deathglow\", a deeply mind-altering illegal booster that has recently found its way into the underground markets of New Eden.",
