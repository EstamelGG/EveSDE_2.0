  "description": "Barely intact as it lies among the wreckage of his ship, this data terminal offers a rare insight into the likely research interests of the enigmatic and reclusive pirate Asitei Ohkunen. Huge amounts of data have been compiled on the neurological states of test subjects, all of them under the effects of various boosters. The reasoning behind these tests remains uncertain, although the narrow focus on electrical impulses inside the brain might suggest an attempt at some kind of digitally-produced emulation.",
