  "description": "This fragile Khumaak appears to be several centuries old, and could perhaps date back to the Starkmanir rebellion itself. <br><br>There are unique markings along the side; tiny holes that appear to have fastened the scepter to a wall at one point. In the centre of the flared orb there is another unique distinguishing mark, the visage of an Amarrian man draped in the robes of a Saint. His name, Torus Arzad, is not mentioned in any contemporary history, Amarrian or otherwise. Below his face a single line of text reads:<br><br>“Understand His mercy, and you will know enough.”",
