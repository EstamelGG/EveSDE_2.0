  "description": "High-ranking officers of the Caldari State Navy are often called upon to attend important command or corporate meetings and are commonly seen wearing their formal dress uniforms. Commander ranks and above are particularly likely to be posted to roles requiring regular wear of their formal dress as the interplay of corporate politics in the Caldari State impinges on their military functions. Many branch, divisional and corporate variations exist but Caldari Navy uniforms are a common sight throughout the State's territories.\n\nThis smartly tailored dress jacket is intended to be worn with the State Commander's Dress Pants, and suitable shoes or boots, to complete the formal dress uniform.",
