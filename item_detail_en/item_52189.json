  "description": "Released in YC121, this special edition entry in the Eico augmentation series celebrates Capsuleer Day XVI.\n\nEnvironmental information capture overlays go several steps beyond somatosensory meshes and considerably enhance the sensory capabilities of those \"wearing\" such extensive facial augmentations. While this level of cybernetics can hardly be masked by mere nanocoatings there is still considerable scope for working in decorative elements.\n\nEico augmentations include systems that improve the connection between an augmented individual's consciousness and their nervous-emotional responses. However, these more extensive and elaborate information capture and processing systems hugely increase the types and range of environmental information that can be absorbed by an individual.\n\nWhether sipping cocktails in the zero-g bars of Caille, or ripping apart the sputtering remains of a pirate vessel with your guns in nullsec, one thing will be certain: those who see your face will have it etched into their memory forever.",
