  "description": "This heavily damaged fluid router appears to offer a low-profile backdoor into classified FIO networks. In a more functional state this unit could have shed some light on whether or not Serpentis Captain Scane Essyn truly defected. Without a way to bypass the various built-in encryption systems, however, it will be impossible to make sense of any recoverable data. This could be proof of Essyn using old knowledge to his advantage in a new career, or simply his link back to one he never abandoned in the first place.",
