  "description": "Poteque Pharmaceuticals has marketed protective glasses, face shields and a variety of other transparent protective devices under their BioCrystal brand for many years. These protective glasses are highly impact resistant, and proof against various forms of radiation, thermal shock and corrosion. The proprietary BioCrystal monomolecular layers have recently been upgraded with protections against rogue nanites following the increase in incidents involving such devices over the last century of New Eden's interstellar era.\n\nProtective glasses of this kind are a useful supplement, along with physical masks, to standard anti-pathogen and biosecurity protocols using selective molecular repulsion fields.",
