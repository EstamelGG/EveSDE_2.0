  "description": "Tahaki Karin is a youngish woman of middling height and build, dressed practically in a mechanic's coveralls. Her hands are rough and heavily callused, and she carries some scars that look like they were caused by shrapnel. Her voice is brisk, carrying a clear expectation that her orders will be followed. She looks like she's seen a lot recently, and none of it's been pleasant.",
