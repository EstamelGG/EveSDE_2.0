  "name": "Mutadaptive Construction Component",
  "description": "Apparently a general purpose construction component, this Triglavian mutadaptive device appears to be designed to work in concert with others of its type, and more specialized components, in order to build structures of various sizes and purposes. Its applications are presumably limited only by its inherent properties and the designs it is programmed to execute.\n\nLarge numbers of these devices are constructed in Triglavian space-industrial sites, including a number apparently farmed out to subverted drones by the Triglavians at locations with the designation \"Vila Allopoiesis Nexus\".",
