  "description": "Arctic Warfare Marines are the Caldari State's elite foot soldiers for winter warfare. On the case of ice planets, where the weather is comprised of year-round snow and ice, you can find these self-sufficient Marines operating in a wide variety of roles, such as providing security for Caldari corporate facilities, military bases, and even for long-range reconnaissance on planets that have not yet been fully scouted. Their equipment is tailored specifically to harsh, sub-zero weather conditions, to include specialty rifles, thermal grenades, cold-weather speeder bikes, and everything in between.",
