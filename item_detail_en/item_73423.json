  "name": "Women's Desert Nomad Mask",
  "description": "Breather masks and similar accoutrements are a common sight in the desert and rocky environments of barren worlds such as Turnur I but this design is particularly sophisticated and unusual. Designed to interface with the nanotech implants of any user, and incorporating adaptive systems that can establish new sub-implants, this mask bears all the signs of being derived from Triglavian hardware, if not itself an example of such technology. The mask itself would be proof against many hazardous environments, protecting the respiratory systems of the wearer from damage and aiding breathing, but appears to have been configured \"desert fashion\" for use in arid and dusty environments.\n\nThe evident fact that Triglavian technology is the foundation of this mask's design and construction is something of a puzzle given the origin of this equipment with the desert planet nomads of the Minmatar clans of Turnur I. A few examples of the original masks were retrieved from Turnur I by corporate mercenaries involved in territorial conflicts and the design subsequently found its way onto the interstellar market. Though quite useful in the space context, as the mask continues to function effectively as protection against many environmental hazards, the choice to wear this mask may be considered an aesthetic or cultural statement.",
