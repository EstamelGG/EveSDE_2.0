  "description": "This speeding ticket was issued by the Directive Enforcement Department to the pilot of a Charon class freighter who was apparently detected travelling at 402,110 m/sec on approach to the Perimeter stargate in the market hub system of Jita. The angry, handwritten response from the capsuleer is undecipherable save for several expletives it would not be appropriate to mention here, and mention of a Machariel class battleship.",
