It provides a dual function; tapping into both the occipital lobe for a perception boost, and also the neocortex, for improving the brain's handling of a ship's energy and capacitor needs. Like the infamous pirate implant sets found on capsuleer markets, each implant is also designed to work at higher levels when integrated into a neural implant network.<br><br>Though many in the augmentation industry initially questioned the agenda behind Genolution's entry into the implantation field, fears eventually subsided as the implant was shown to be one of the safest on record. Genolution went one step further to assuage fears however and vowed never to release the implant to open markets, providing only a single-run issue to capsuleers as a demonstration of the technology.",
