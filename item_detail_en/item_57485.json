  "description": "Genetic Mutation Inhibitors are a component in the safeguarding measures adopted by EDENCOM and the empires during the Triglavian Invasions. Passive defense against mutagenic attack or other causes of mutations are an important element of the safeguarding filter suite.\n\nDue to the mastery of mutaplasmids and other biotechnology demonstrated by the Triglavians, the risk of subversion through genetic tampering or outright mutagenic warfare attacks led EDENCOM to mandate safeguards for capsuleers piloting the most powerful naval vessels.",
