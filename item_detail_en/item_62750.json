  "description": "AIR's mining operations require suitable claims to be surveyed by the most experienced members of the organization's mining division, and like many mining enterprises they sometimes supplement the ranks of this dangerous profession with freelancers. \n\nThe AIR Claim Surveyor Suit is a customized version of the special exploration suit adapted for claim survey work by the Outer Ring Excavations corporation. AIR have made their own upgrades, and styled the suit to their corporate identity for use by their own experts and any freelancers working for them.\n\nSeeing an opportunity in the market for variable atmosphere and gravity exploration gear, the Impro corporation developed its 'Impro-XS' integrated clothing and equipment line. The gear's superior environmental adaptation technology resulted in a rapid take up from various corporations across New Eden.",
