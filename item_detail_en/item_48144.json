  "description": "This is an accurate scale replica of the first vessel that left the planet Gallentia (Gallente Prime) on a voyage to reach a neighboring planet that showed signs of human habitation in 22517AD. This planet was known at the time as Cephalin but ultimately would be known as Caldari Prime.\n\nThe vessel was commissioned by the International Space Cooperative, an organization born with the intent of letting Gallentia's nations reach the stars. In effect, this enterprise was the beginning of the space age that would lead to the star-straddling Gallente Federation.",
