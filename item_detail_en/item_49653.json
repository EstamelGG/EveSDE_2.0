  "name": "Colonize! Board Game",
  "description": "This board game, produced by Caldari megacorporation NOH, was widely panned by critics as lacking proper game balance when it was released. It is almost always optimal for a player to seize personal power and exercise it over the other players, with other routes being comparatively fruitless when trying to establish your new colony's society. While sales were weak in many places, the game is extremely popular among Blood Raiders and is even sometimes used as a teaching tool in their schools.",
