  "description": "This strange-looking piece of equipment was discovered unharmed amid the shattered hull of Guristas Lieutenant Sukkenen Fusura's vessel. Although baffling in its complexity, it is clearly used as a tool to breach secure networks. All the software appears to be proprietary, however.
