  "description": "RCM play an important role in stabilizing a ship's alignment prior to, and in the first moments of, interstellar warp. The Sleeper drone RCM system works in an entirely different manner to contemporary Empire-based technology and yet the angles of alignment produced by their final calculations are always identical. Even though their inner workings remain a mystery, the matrices operate in a predictable and reliable enough fashion to form the basis of a new, slightly more efficient jump drive.",
