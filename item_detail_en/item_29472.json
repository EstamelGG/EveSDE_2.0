  "description": "Before the advent of electronics, these writing tools were used throughout the Achuran continent. In times of war, it was not at all uncommon for a victor to use a brush-like pen to draw stylized icons representing the outcome of the battle and the heroics performed by his side. These icons would then be copied and molded onto an ivory or metal stamp, which was dipped into hot wax and used to stamp the victor's seal on the final agreement.\n\nIt should be noted that the brushes and stamps are not the only tools in this box. Cleaning implements are of course included, and so are tiny pliers and some manner of disinfectant, for it was traditional that the victor's brush be inset with eyelashes drawn from the screaming conquered.",
