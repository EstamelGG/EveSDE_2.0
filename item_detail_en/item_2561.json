  "description": "\"At some point, it all comes down to more metal.\" The designers of this storage site believed this adage above all else. The outer walls of each container are comprised of almost a meter of titanium alloy around a flexible, lightweight tritanium frame, all sealed with a few layers of active nanite coating to prevent microfractures and thermal warping. This combination allows the building to withstand nearly any environmental challenge. To prevent the tritanium supports from decaying, the interior is kept in a constant vacuum, and workers must wear fully sealed atmosphere suits at all times.",
