  "name": "Women's Desert Nomad Goggles",
  "description": "These rugged goggles are evidently adapted for environments where heat, stellar radiation and dust are an ever-present fact of life, though are based on a tried and tested frame design able to incorporate a variety of features. Goggles like these are common equipment in deserts and other arid or rocky environments, with their built in dust repulsion and temperature control fields making them particularly useful in a range of planetary environments.\n\nThis particular design has been heavily configured for use in the deep desert and incorporates a number of vision modes and an improved binocular augmentation, together with heavy-duty repulsion fields and ultraviolet filtering fields. The customizations speak to the origin of this goggle design with the desert planet nomads of the Minmatar clans of Turnur I, though in the capsuleer context would be mostly an aesthetic or cultural choice of apparel.",
