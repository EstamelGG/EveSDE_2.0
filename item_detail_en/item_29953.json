  "description": "This data storage unit must have contained invaluable insights into ongoing Sansha's Nation operations. However, it is encased within a neodymium trigger mechanism which caused it to auto-delete every single file in its database the moment it was exposed to the cold vacuum of space. A design utilizing the atmospheric reactivity of neodymium lies at the cutting edge of technology, requiring a level of ingenuity and craftsmanship well outside a True Slave's capabilities and indeed even beyond that of its former owner, Sansha's Nation Captain Toriiko Aanai. Stranger still, however, is the fact that this shell was also clearly designed to survive the explosion of her ship.",
