  "description": "<b>Paper:</b> Project Blueprint<br>\n<b>Lead Researchers:</b> Adainy Gwanwyn, Emily Dallocort<br>\n<b>Contributors:</b> Mark726<br>\n<b>Summary:</b> The premise of Project Blueprint is to acquire photographic samples (along with standard documentation) of Sleeper constructs to determine their similarity, if any, to those produced in known space. Currently, researchers are in the initial phases of gathering samples of New Eden's structures to compare to the Sleeper constructs once wormhole excursions begin.\n\nThe purpose behind gathering this information is manifold:<br>\n   1. To investigate if Sleeper constructs hold any sort of cultural significance to the Sleepers themselves;<br>\n   2. To investigate if Sleepers build their constructs to establish permanent homes or temporary sites<br>\n   3. To assist in determining the relationship between Sleepers and the Talocan.\n\nUltimately, information gathered from Project Blueprint could be used to assist other Project teams (ideally, those under the <a href=evebrowser:http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Arek%27Jaalan:_Sleeper_History>Sleeper History division</a>), and to help further the efforts of those in the Arek'Jaalan initiative.\n\n<i>This abstract relates to research undertaken by the <a href=evebrowser: http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Arek%27Jaalan>Arek'Jaalan Project.</a></i>\n\n<i>Authorized for capsuleer dissemination under the CONCORD Freedom of Distribution Act (Alpha-One-Five), YC 113.11.4</i>\n\n<i>Further copies of this document can be obtained through the Arek'Jaalan administrative site, located in the <a href=showinfo:5//30003413>Eram</a> system.<i>",
