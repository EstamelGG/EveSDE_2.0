  "description": "IV-Grade or moonshine ytirium is a very rare form of the ore with a relative density of <a href=showinfo:37>Isogen</a> mineral content 15% greater than the standard form.\n\nYtirium is a rare ore that contains a useful concentration of the Isogen mineral in relatively dense deposits. Though found in remote clusters of asteroids, the ore is readily transportable and easily refined into the useful mineral it contains.\n\nA special \"Deep Space Survey\" partnership between Ducia Foundry,  Eifyr and Co., Mordu's Legion, and Ytiri was forged by the four members of the Upwell Consortium in order to carry out prospecting expeditions at the edges of empire space, deep in nullsec, and even beyond to wormhole space. In YC124, these survey missions were able to identify a number of rare ore types, each containing an unusually pure deposit of a standard mineral. Ytirium was the Isogen-bearing ore discovered by this group and was named for the Ytiri corporation contribution to the surveying expeditions.\n\nAvailable primarily in nullsec and W-space systems containing A0 (Blue Small) stars, as well as surveyed locations on the borders of empire and nullsec space.",
