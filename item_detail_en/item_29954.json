  "description": "This appears to be the logical nexus of the Phantasm-class cruiser once piloted by what was most probably a True Slave. Although heavily damaged following the explosion that freed it from the vessel, there are several semi-functional tactical subroutines still in operation now, seemingly unaware of their disconnection. The circuitry appears to have at one point been integrated into the pilot in some way, forming a frighteningly efficient harmony of mind and machine. Most disconcerting however, is the fact that various aspects of the software technology could only be a few years old.",
