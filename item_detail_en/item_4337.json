The most interesting one is a certain fungus found on several temperate worlds.\n\nThis fungus appears able to colonize almost any surface or other organism. As it digests another organism, some proteins from that organism are displayed on the surface of the fungal strands. This allows the fungus to evade the immune system of many infected hosts.\n\nSome bacteria were also found that appear to be somewhat infectious. They do not appear to be too virulent, but some of the chemicals they produce are of particular interest. These chemicals have neurological effects that alter the behavior of the host, helping spread the bacteria.\n\n<i>This abstract relates to research undertaken by the <a href=evebrowser: http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Arek%27Jaalan>Arek'Jaalan Project.</a></i>\n\n<i>Authorized for capsuleer dissemination under the CONCORD Freedom of Distribution Act (Alpha-One-Five), YC 113.11.4</i>\n\n<i>Further copies of this document can be obtained through the Arek'Jaalan administrative site, located in the <a href=showinfo:5//30003413>Eram</a> system.<i>",
