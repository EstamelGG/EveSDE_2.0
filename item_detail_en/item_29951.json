  "name": "DisX Stash",
  "description": "Encapsulated in a resilient Mexallon alloy container, this drug stash was clearly intended to survive the explosion of Angel Lieutenant Thora Faband's vessel, most likely so it could be recovered by her Cartel associates. A cursory analysis of the contents reveals them to be a modified version of an X-Instinct variant known as “DisX” which possesses greatly increased dissociative elements that serve to heighten sensory deprivation. Strangely enough, these drugs are most popular among the Matari tribes that she cheated to make them. They value DisX as a catalyst for self-exploration and spiritual insight.",
