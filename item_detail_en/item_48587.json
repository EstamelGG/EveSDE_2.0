  "description": "The Jade Coast of Matar, named so because of its vibrant green mineral sands, actually produces a considerable amount of the ornamental material in the alluvial deposits of the Tronhadar river delta that is a dominant feature of the local geography. Long ago, in the ancient past of the Minmatar, the hard-wearing jade would be used as a material for tools as well as ornamental objects. \n\nToday, the Jade Coast serves as an ideal vacation destination, and many casinos operate along its beaches and on the placid waters of the delta. Jade dice are staple curios of such casinos, although tourists are advised to seek only games where transparent polymer dice are being used.",
