Omega seeks to uncover anything that can be learned about their hierarchy and society by recording how the various rogue drone types interact with one another and other hives. Omega also studies the software of the rogue drones, analyzing their intelligence and their psychology in an effort to identify the programming code responsible for their behavior. \n\nResearch into existing types of hives found “naturally occurring” has been carried out and a comparative psychology study is also underway. These examinations should provide deeper insights into the nature of rogue drones and their hives.\n\n<i>This abstract relates to research undertaken by the <a href=evebrowser: http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Arek%27Jaalan>Arek'Jaalan Project.</a></i>\n\n<i>Authorized for capsuleer dissemination under the CONCORD Freedom of Distribution Act (Alpha-One-Five), YC 113.11.4</i>\n\n<i>Further copies of this document can be obtained through the Arek'Jaalan administrative site, located in the <a href=showinfo:5//30003413>Eram</a> system.<i>",
