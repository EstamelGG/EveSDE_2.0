  "name": "Korrani's DNA",
  "description": "Once a member of the elite ranks within the Mordu's Legion Command, Korrani was a popular role model for young and aspiring pilots within the mercenary organization. Because of this it was even more surprising that such a talented and well known fighter pilot would be caught up in a murder trial... of his own brother, who stood to inherit most of the real estate empire previously in possession of his Caldari grandfather. Korrani's tale, although sad, is currently used by mentors within the Mordus Legion to teach new recruits a valuable lesson on life. But meanwhile, Korrani has made quite a name for himself within the underworld, choosing to live the life of a rogue freelancer rather than face trial in his nation of birth for murder. Korrani operates a powerfull Mordu ship fitted with top notch equipment, a worthy adversary for any decent fighter pilot.",
