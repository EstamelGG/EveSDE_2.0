  "description": "The medicinal herbs of the Vherokior can be easily brewed into a tea with hallucinogenic properties. Such preparations are intended for use in traditional Vherokior mysticism but have become popular among Minmatar and Gallente youth.\n\nThese herbs are not distributed commercially, but are rather provided in various specialty mixes by Vherokior apothecaries on both sides of the border. The Vherokior ask no questions of those wishing to use the herb preparations, reasoning that the use of their mixes to enter altered states of consciousness is a personal matter.",
