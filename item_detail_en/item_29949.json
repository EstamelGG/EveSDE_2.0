  "description": "Bizarrely enough, it seems that Angel Cartel Lieutenant Tolan Akochi has been carrying around a CONCORD dog tag, even going to the trouble of protecting it against the rigors of exposure in space. A database query on the ID number offers a grim explanation as to why, revealing that it belongs to an ex-SARO Commander. Although nothing about him is listed on the CONCORD public network, third party news articles related to his name detail how he once lead an offensive on Serpentis Inquest Headquarters. Initially thought to be a success, later pieces tell the story of what eventually amounted to a large-scale operational failure in the face of unexpected resistance. The final article available outlines a particularly gruesome death suffered by him, his entire family and a swathe of known associates.",
