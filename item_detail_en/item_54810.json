  "description": "The component name and serial number of this obscure piece of technology is indicated clearly by data-tags bearing CONCORD, Upwell Consortium and EDENCOM identifier codes. This highly advanced device is apparently capable of evaluating the charge of cosmic string elements in local space-time despite the extraordinary sensitivity that such a piece of equipment would require. It is built in such a way that it must be part of a larger design.",
