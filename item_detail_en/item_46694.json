  "description": "This extremely rare and valuable variant of dark ochre ore was recently discovered by ORE engineers during early field tests of new moon mining technology. Subsequent testing has confirmed that this ore produces 15% more minerals than standard dark ochre when reprocessed.\n\nConsidered a worthless ore for years, dark ochre was ignored by most miners until improved reprocessing techniques managed to extract the huge amount of <a href=showinfo:37>Isogen</a> and <a href=showinfo:36>Mexallon</a> inside it. Dark ochre also contains useful amounts of <a href=showinfo:38>Nocxium</a>.\n\n<i>This material was compressed using an older process that compressed batches of raw materials into units using a set input quantity. Newer compression technology uses a more flexible one-to-one unit compression system.</i>",
