ORE has declared that they will provide a reward of 1 billion ISK to any capsuleers that return one of their researchers alive and well to one of their stations in the Outer Ring region.\n\nKidnapped ORE Researchers can be returned to the ORE corporation by being traded through market buy orders at any of the four stations operated by ORE.",
