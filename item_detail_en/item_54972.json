  "name": "Ultraconducting Ablative Nanocable",
  "description": "Ultra high-power loads will typically burn out even the most advanced superconducting cables, calling for a radical solution in cases where high bursts of power are required at relatively high frequencies. Ultraconducting ablative nanocable is able to repeatedly transmit high-power loads by actively exchanging the material of the cable with an integrated pool of nanomaterial between pulses.",
