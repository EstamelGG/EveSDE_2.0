  "description": "Painstakingly written by hand in an antiquated Nefantar script, these memoirs outline the short-lived fortunes of an Ammatar clan known as the Hauteker â€“ long since lost to time. The memoir's focus seems to be on the preservation of family tradition; the highly detailed passages document everything from the way the Hauteker family dressed to where they were all buried.",
