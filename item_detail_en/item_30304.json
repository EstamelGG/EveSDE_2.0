  "description": "The discovery of these microscopic, tubular structures has helped pave new paths in the construction of advanced starships. Known for their unrivaled strength-to-weight ratio, composite metals made of unique PPD fullerene fibers have become the standard for defensive plating. Atomic-scale, nanomechanical systems used inside repair modules often employ fullerene fibers as well.",
