  "description": "Several interconnected underwater buildings comprise the oceanic command center, which serves as the nervous system for node structures built on water worlds. Built on the ocean floor, this facility includes a thick umbilical that connects it to a communications pod floating on the surface, through which all interplanetary transmissions are sent and received. It also houses a basic two-stage pressurized rocket tube for getting people and cargo to the surface and thence off world into orbit.",
