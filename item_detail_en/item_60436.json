  "description": "This T-Shirt is part of a 'Sanguine Harvest' set of clothing worn by adherents of the Blooder Raider sect. The Blood Raiders are a fanatical splinter from an ancient cult called Sani Sabik, which uses blood in their rituals. The Blood Raiders believe that cloned bodies have 'purer' blood than other bodies and this explains why they operate mainly in space, attacking unwary space farers and draining their bodies of blood. The Blood Raiders are led by the fearsome Omir Sarikusa, who has remained on top of the DED most wanted list for many years now.",
