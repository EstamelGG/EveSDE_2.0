  "description": "Mannar, one of the oldest members of the Federation, has always had a strong influence on Gallente style and trendsetting. Much of the eccentric tailoring favored by society's elite and decried as immodest and inappropriate by the other empires has its roots in pre-Federation Mannar culture, which included different concepts of modesty and etiquette. Massive hairstyles and elaborate body- and face-painting still feature prominently in addition to semi-opaque fabrics which respond to a variety of programmable stimuli.",
