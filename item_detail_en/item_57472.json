  "description": "Stress-Responding Trigger Neurolink Conduits are vital components in the network of connections linking the neural hardware of a capsuleer to the many key systems of a spaceship.\n\nWhile all capsuleer neurolink technologies rely on the autonomic biosystems of pilots, Gallente research and development explored the use of the capsuleer's stress-response mechanisms to establish a reliable integration of neurolinks with ship systems.",
