  "description": "Following the success of the Frostline Laboratories experimental trials with Triglavian filament technology, the Outer Ring Excavations group authorized the commencement of \"Project Needlejack\". Working in conjunction with Frostline, ORE Technologies was able to refine the technology into a cost-effective product even though the means of precisely establishing a conduit destination continued to elude its scientists.\n\nMature production models include a filament device that opens a conduit able to transport 15 ships to an apparently random destination, within broad parameters based on \"noise profiles\" in the underlying quantum fluctuations of space-time. ORE's development team configured this production model to target quantum noise profiles typical of known nullsec regions.\n\nThe Noise-15 'Needlejack' Filament device is being made available through production blueprints to corporations and other entities with good business relations with ORE. Capsuleers with access to ORE loyalty programs may find the Noise-15 variant a useful tool or lucrative product offering.",
