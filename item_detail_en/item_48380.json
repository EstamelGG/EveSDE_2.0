  "name": "Women's Triglavian Survival Suit (Veles)",
  "description": "This Triglavian survival suit bears the symbol of the Triglavian grouping called the \"Veles Clade\". CONCORD intelligence has established few hard facts about any of the clades but they are clearly major subdivisions within Triglavian society. The Veles Clade seems to be strong in the fields of heavy space industry, communications technology and high-energy exotic particle physics.\n\nThe Veles Clade also appears to emphasizes discourse within the Triglavian Collective, after a fashion, over strife â€“ that is, if the evidence has been understood correctly. This Triglavian survival suit was probably sourced from the black market and care should be taken to ensure that the bioadaptive technology typically found in such items has been deactivated and removed.",
