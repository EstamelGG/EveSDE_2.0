  "description": "Found among the wreckage of Angel Captain Artey Vinck's vessel, this innocuous looking data core actually holds a wealth of information about previous Federation Customs patrol routes, now probably a little outdated. The level of detail is staggering: including locations of almost every single Customs vessel in operation across the entire Sinq Laison region. With information like this, a smuggler could pass undetected anywhere they pleased with complete impunity. Attached to the information is a brief note bearing the logo of Serpentis Corporation that reads “Fly safe Artey, times change. As ever, I.C.”",
