  "name": "Women's Gallente Federation Exploration Suit",
  "description": "The Gallente Federation's version of the Exploration Suit has primarily been adopted by federal agencies that have a need to operate in varying but habitable environments. The Gallente Federal Marshals have found the gear particularly useful given the wide variety of planetary, moon and asteroid, and station and spaceship environments in which they find themselves operating.\n\nSeeing an opportunity in the market for variable atmosphere and gravity exploration gear, the Impro corporation developed its 'Impro-XS' integrated clothing and equipment line. The gear's superior environmental adaptation technology resulted in a rapid take up from various corporations across New Eden.",
