As it is independent from your clone and your capsule, an active Expert System is not lost on pod death or clone jump.\n\n<font size=\"14\"><b>Activating an Expert System</b></font>\n\nActivation of an Expert System is automatic upon redemption of the item by the specific capsuleer intending to use the service.\n\n<i>Expert Systems are a product developed by the PKN Interstellar consortium, made available over the HyperNet FTL communications network, and marketed by PKN Interstellar member corporations. An Expert System is a restricted AI based on artificial gelbrain technology. As the Expert System uses neural pathways based on those created by skill training or skill injection, it is compatible with capsule-ship interface and control systems. Real time command and control communication is achieved using dedicated FTL channels on PKN Interstellar's HyperNet.</i>",
