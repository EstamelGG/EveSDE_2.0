  "description": "This Abyssal Filament will pull a <b>Tech I or Tech II Cruiser</b> into a pocket of Abyssal Deadspace with a <b>tranquil environment</b>, and saturated with exotic particles that will <b>reduce kinetic resistance</b> but <b>enhance scan resolution</b>.\n\n<b><color=yellow>Restrictions:</color></b>  Cannot be activated in 1.0 or 0.9 systems. \n\n<b><color=yellow>Warning:</color></b> Abyssal Deadspace is a particularly harsh and unforgiving environment. Entanglement of the warp core with a space-time filament introduces severe deformations of the ship's warp field that cumulatively increase over time. After <b><color=yellow>20 minutes</color></b> catastrophic collapse of the warp field is predicted, with <b><color=yellow>destruction of the ship and capsule</color></b> certain.\n\nA device of Triglavian design that functions as one end of an energetically inert filament of space-time connected to a specific pocket of Abyssal Deadspace. When activated by a ship equipped with a warp core that has the correct mass-energy parameters, the filament becomes a conduit that will draw the activating vessel along it and into the connected deadspace pocket. \n\nThe mass-energy exchange involved leaves a highly energetic trace at the ship's origin point and the space-time filament remains entangled with the warp core of the ship that uses it. Triglavian Transfer Conduits will permit such a ship to progress through the deadspace pocket but an Origin Conduit will return the ship to its starting location in normal space.",
