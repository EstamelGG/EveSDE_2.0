This AI virus ravaged the Sleeper species, but not before they transmitted a large quantity of data to a secure storage device they had sent far from their own region of space. This data, when uncovered, gave rise to the rogue drone species.\n\nThis paper was created to serve as a theoretical basis for future projects.\n\n<i>This abstract relates to research undertaken by the Arek'Jaalan Project.</i>\n\n<i>Authorized for capsuleer dissemination under the CONCORD Freedom of Distribution Act (Alpha-One-Five), YC 113.11.4</i>\n\n<i>Further copies of this document can be obtained through the Arek'Jaalan administrative site, located in the <a href=showinfo:5//30003413>Eram</a> system.<i>",
