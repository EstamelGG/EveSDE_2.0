  "description": "The DED's Reserve Frontier Safeguard service, commonly known as the RFS or \"Safeguarders\", has its origins in a lowsec/nullsec frontier patrol operated using reservists from the member states of CONCORD. The RFS originally provided a security patrol presence in lowsec systems with planetary colonies and other orbital settlements. Since the expansion of CONCORD's mandate and permanent DED fleet capacity in YC105, the RFS has evolved into an organization focused on providing disaster relief to colonies across lowsec space.\n\nThe ships of the Frontier Safeguard carry specialized personnel and equipment prepared to deal with all manner of environmental hazards. The RFS will respond to emergencies involving such challenges as super cyclones, tsunamis, continental wildfires, global duststorms, and seismic and volcanic events. Their specialized shuttles and dropsuited Safeguarders will unhesitatingly deploy from orbit into some of the most dangerous and remote environmental disaster zones in New Eden. Still funded by the CONCORD Assembly and staffed by reservists from the member empires, the Safeguarders are a welcome sight for any remote settlement desperately in need of their aid.",
