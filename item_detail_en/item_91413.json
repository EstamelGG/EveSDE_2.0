  "name": "Canned Quantum Superposition Wormhole",
  "description": "A container with what appears to be a micro-wormhole inside. When observed, the wormhole seems to vanish, but when left to its own devices, a very small negative pressure vacuum seems to be exerted on the inside of the casing. It simultaneously acknowledges the existence of wormholes, but also provides no visual proof of their existence.",
