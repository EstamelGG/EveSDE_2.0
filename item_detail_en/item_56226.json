  "description": "Subversive elements across New Eden have found something attractive, even uplifting in Zorya Triglav's message of \"proving and joining the flow\". The radicals of the Internal Triglavian Revolutionary Organization, also known as \"Intriguerre\", claim that the Triglavian invasion represents \"a dynamic moment of challenge and opportunity for posthumanity\".\n\nDespite being hunted by agents of CONCORD's Special Affairs for Regulations and Order (SARO), Intriguerre has continued to propagandize in support of the Collective and pro-Triglavian capsuleers. Given their access to Triglavian Survival Suits, and the means to distribute them to committed supporters of the Collective, the evidence for Triglavian co-operation with the Internal Triglavian Revolutionary Organization is mounting.\n\nAwarded in the name of Zorya Triglav, this Triglavian Survival Suit is a mark of the wearer's commitment to the Triglavian Collective's efforts to achieve Final Liminality where they deem it necessary.",
