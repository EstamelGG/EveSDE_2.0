The real vessel is berthed in Hek VII - Tribal Liberation Force Logistic Support after managing to limp back across the Amarr-Matari border and make port, and is preserved as a monument to the Elder Fleet invasion of the Empire during YC110, which saw countless Matari slaves liberated and evacuated from Imperial space.",
