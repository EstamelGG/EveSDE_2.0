  "description": "By the time the Fourth Alliance Tournament began, many pundits in New Eden considered the <url=showinfo:16159//632866070>Band of Brothers</url> team unstoppable. After three years of undefeated dominance and running a team setup claimed as “unbeatable” by their captain, it seemed like nobody could defeat <url=showinfo:16159//632866070>Band of Brothers</url>. That is, until the former champions came up against the <url=showinfo:16159//1439416485>The Star Fraction</url> on the final day of the tournament.
