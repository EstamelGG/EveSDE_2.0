  "description": "This sharp-looking decoration in golden hue draws its inspiration from ancient Amarr tradition, and has received greater attention in recent years due to the tendency of people of royal blood to wear it at official functions.\n\nIt is regal and imposing, with an otherworldly - and some say devilish - appearance, and in its clean design it is said to offer several different interpretations depending on whether the onlooker is standing at attention or supplicating on their knees. It  might be a halo around the wearer's head, gently implying her sanctified nature. it might be a set of wings that indicate the eventual heavenly flight of her soul. Or it might be the spikes on which those who displease her will be impaled.",
