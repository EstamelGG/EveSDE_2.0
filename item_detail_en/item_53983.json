  "description": "Following the success of the Frostline Laboratories experimental trials with Triglavian filament technology, the Outer Ring Excavations group authorized the commencement of \"Project Needlejack\". Working in conjunction with Frostline, ORE Technologies was able to refine the technology into a cost-effective product even though the means of precisely establishing a conduit destination continued to elude its scientists.\n\nClassified military variants of the technology include a filament device that opens a conduit able to transport 25 ships to a pseudorandom destination weighted by \"signal profiles\" discernible in the quantum fluctuations of space-time. ORE's development team configured this military variant to target quantum signal profiles suggesting higher levels of activity in nullsec space systems.\n\nThe Signal-25 'Needlejack' Filament is a highly restricted piece of technology but is sometimes made available to capsuleers in limited numbers as a means to support certain operational goals of ORE, the Upwell Consortium, and their strategic partners. Very occasionally, like any desirable piece of military tech, the devices even turn up in the hands of competitors or outlaw groups.",
