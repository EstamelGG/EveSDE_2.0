  "description": "All of these Caldari P.O.Ws show the signs of appalling treatment over an extended period of time. Even the most well-off are still suffering from starvation and serious malnourishment. The worst of them are barely alive after enduring sleep deprivation, physical abuse and other more excessive forms of torture. The women in particular, have not fared well under their Gallente jail masters, who have remorselessly taken whatever they desired from their captured prey.",
