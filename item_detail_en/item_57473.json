  "description": "Goal-Orienting Trigger Neurolink Conduits are vital components in the network of connections linking the neural hardware of a capsuleer to the many key systems of a spaceship.\n\nWhile all capsuleer neurolink technologies rely on the autonomic biosystems of pilots, Minmatar research and development took the radical approach of using goal-orienting autonomic heuristics to establish a reliable integration of neurolinks with ship systems.",
