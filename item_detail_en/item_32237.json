  "description": "These dog tags are crudely constructed and chipped at the edges. The words are scrawled across the metal in a rough fashion, which feel hasty in their inscription. The name on the dog tag appears to be Caldari, though it is difficult to tell. A serial number also appears, as well as the acronym “D-IDS/IS.”",
