While the status of Jirai 'Fatal' Laitanen remains shrouded in mystery, his elite cadre of pirate technology hunters continues to operate across New Eden.\n\nThe Fatal Elite are noted for a particular focus on searching out and \"acquiring\" advanced capsule, cloning and personality transfer technology. The application of such technology to ever more responsive and high-performance combat craft is of extreme interest to the Guristas Pirates.",
