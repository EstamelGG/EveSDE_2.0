Corporation<br>\n<b>Summary:</b> Operation Trinity was the in-field reconnaissance operation to gather experimental evidence to prove or deny the Trinity Hypothesis, part of Project Trinity. Conducted inside Class 4 space, the operation utilized military and scientific vessels to investigate Trinary Hub facilities in order to determine whether they held any similarity to the <a href=showinfo:11066>Trinary Data</a> discovered on an abandoned Helios in Class 6 space, suspected to have once belonged to missing astrophysicist Lianda Burreau, the first capsuleer to discover the unknown regions. \n\nA trinary hub was investigated and the Sleeper databanks located at the structure were hacked. Data analyzers were applied to all artifacts and signals captured from the facility were compared with a Jovian Trinary Data fragment acquired from Admiral Ouria's Eidolon battleship. Correlations were collected and indicate possible relationships between Jovian and Sleeper data structures. Additional conclusions may be possible with assistance from Eifyr & Co.\n\n<i>This abstract relates to research undertaken by the Arek'Jaalan Project.</i>\n\n<i>Authorized for capsuleer dissemination under the CONCORD Freedom of Distribution Act (Alpha-One-Five), YC 113.11.4</i>\n\n<i>Further copies of this document can be obtained through the Arek'Jaalan administrative site, located in the <a href=showinfo:5//30003413>Eram</a> system.<i>",
