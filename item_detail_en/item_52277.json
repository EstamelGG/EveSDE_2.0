  "name": "Fall of Fort Knocks YC120",
  "description": "At the end of YC120, roughly in the middle of the sixteenth year since the inception of independent capsuleers, the notorious Fort Knocks was destroyed in the culmination of a determined campaign to destroy the first Keepstar citadel ever built by capsuleers. The defense of Fort Knocks, anchored deep in the W-space system of J115405, was equally determined but in the final battle the Keepstar fell, ending the fortress's domination of the star system nicknamed \"Rage\".\n\nSince its construction in YC118 by the Hard Knocks Citizens alliance, the Keepstar had endured through many battles but the assault by a coalition of foes lead by The Initiative chipped away at Fort Knocks's defensive network of starbases, eventually achieving local space superiority and dooming New Eden's first Keepstar to its inevitable fate.",
