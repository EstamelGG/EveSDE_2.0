  "description": "Explorers have recovered many artefacts from the Bioadaptive Caches that the Triglavian Collective have seeded throughout Abyssal Deadspace, including examples of what appear to be survival suits of some kind. While obviously designed to be worn by humans, those wishing to try this new look may want to deactivate and remove the various pieces of bioadaptive technology found in the lining of these sophisticated items of apparel.",
