  "description": "<font size=\"14\"><b>Gallente Federation Day Expert System </b></font>\n\nThis Expert System makes available skills enabling a capsuleer to fly Gallente Tech 1 and Navy frigate-type, destroyer-type and cruiser-type ships along with Gallente-focused supporting skills. This is a promotional Expert System released to celebrate the Federation Day.\n\n<b>The temporary skills provided by this Expert System last for four days.</b>\n\nAn Expert System is a remote, restricted artificial intelligence providing you with access to certain skills during the active rental period. As it is independent from your clone and your capsule, an active Expert System is not lost on pod death or clone jump.\n\n<font size=\"14\"><b>Activating an Expert System</b></font>\n\nActivation of an Expert System is automatic upon redemption of the item by the specific capsuleer intending to use the service.\n\n<i>Expert Systems are a product developed by the PKN Interstellar consortium, made available over the HyperNet FTL communications network, and marketed by PKN Interstellar member corporations. An Expert System is a restricted AI based on artificial gelbrain technology. As the Expert System uses neural pathways based on those created by skill training or skill injection, it is compatible with capsule-ship interface and control systems. Real time command and control communication is achieved using dedicated FTL channels on PKN Interstellar's HyperNet.</i>",
