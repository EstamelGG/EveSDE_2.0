  "description": "The contents of this container remain sealed behind some kind of proprietary Cartel technology. A thin, red film of hardened fullerene alloys forms a perfect, unbreakable seal around the contents. As if that wasn't enough to deter attackers, the surface underneath the film is covered in tiny nanite-plasma explosives. Any attempt at forced entry past the film would produce enough explosive power to level a small town.",
