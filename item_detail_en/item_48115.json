  "description": "<font color=\"#ff3399cc\"><b>+9% turret damage, +9% missile damage, 9% vorton projector damage. Duration 30 minutes.</b></font>\n\nA novel and powerful addition to the range of neural boosters available to capsuleers, the Agency's ‘Pyrolancea’ compounds introduce a temporary but highly adaptive neural lace into the user’s synaptic structures. This 'Pyrolancea' lace enhances neural centers involved in calibration of munitions payloads and weapons energy profiles on the fly during high-intensity combat. The increase in the processing available to the capsuleer means that payload calibration solutions can be tailored more finely and results in improved damage yields against any given target.\n\nCompounds with the Agency identifier are being seeded into target locations identified by the mysterious network ahead of sponsored operations. Entities occupying the target sites often collect the Agency's support drops themselves even if they realize what they must portend. The Agency’s novel method of supporting capsuleer operations is thought to be as much an experiment as it is an incentive for freelance pilots to take up the public contracts.",
