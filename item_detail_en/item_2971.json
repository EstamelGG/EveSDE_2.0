  "name": "Group of Haakar's Striking Hawks",
  "description": "Haakar is a small, unassuming woman in her 40s who wields discipline like a whip. The men and women who follow her command – her Striking Hawks mercenary group – all served with or under her in the Republic Infantry's 203rd Tactical Recon before the company was made redundant by policy changes fifteen years ago. Haakar bears a grudge against bureaucracy for cutting short her career, but says her work now gives her professional satisfaction and an autonomy she enjoys.",
