  "description": "A power control and distribution system component used in Triglavian ship designs and others adapted from such designs. Potentially useful as a component in various other technologies.\n\nTriglavian power systems produce vast quantities of energy, harvesting and converting the energy from singularity radiation, and use zero-point field manipulation to control, distribute and even store this energy.",
