  "name": "Slaver Tooth Necklace",
  "description": "This cord of yellowish fangs is typical of many with a claimed history of being the spoils from raids on Amarr slave camps, the story going that the necklace is formed of teeth from the Slaver Hounds killed during such raids.\n\nFar from the effects of decay, the teeth have not fared well since parting with their owner. A scattering of little notch marks suggests they were forcibly removed â€“ perhaps hurriedly or the creature they came from was in its death throes at the time. (The idea that anyone would try to remove the teeth from a Slaver Hound short of being mortally wounded seems far-fetched.)\n\nThe varying sizes of the teeth offer little clue to whether they came from one creature or many. However, their immense length, some as long as seven centimeters, does indeed point to the Amarr slaveholders' favored Syrikos Hound as a likely source.",
