They have had a strong presence in the Alliance Tournament from the beginning, including a semi-final performance for their <url=showinfo:16159//2031941852>Interstellar Alcohol Conglomerate</url> team in the Second Alliance Tournament. However it is their ATIII <url=showinfo:16159//2031941852>IAC</url> team that made the biggest mark on history. Building their core strategy around cap warfare supported by the massive capacitor pool of a rare and priceless <url=showinfo:11936>Apocalypse Imperial Issue</url>, <url=showinfo:16159//2031941852>IAC</url> made short work of most opponents until facing off against <url=showinfo:16159//99001003>Cult of War</url> who managed to counter the <url=showinfo:16159//2031941852>IAC</url> nosferatu and destroy the <url=showinfo:11936>Apocalypse Imperial Issue</url> to the amazement of the crowd.
