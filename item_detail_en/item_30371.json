  "description": "Fullerite is the solid-state manifestation of fullerene molecules and can be found naturally occurring within interstellar gas clouds. Fullerites are coveted for the unique structural properties that make them some of the most useful materials known to humankind. Fullerene-based technology has applications in electronics, propulsion and engineering as well as the construction of ultra-hard metal alloys and heat-resistant weapons systems.\n\nAlthough all of the empires have developed a rudimentary understanding of how to manipulate fullerene, only the Jovians are known to have mastered the science. This has allowed them to maintain a significant technological advantage over other races in many crucial areas.",
