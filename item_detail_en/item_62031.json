  "description": "This is a collection of data obtained from analysis of peculiar debris and ruins in locations and pockets affected by a Warp Matrix Convergence. The data is highly complex and gives only a partial picture of these strange phenomena, but seems to show that paradoxical pockets of spacetime have been formed at the confluence of \"knots\" of spacetime. These knots are apparently made up of innumerable filaments drawn from many different spatiotemporal locations.\n\nThe unusual source and nature of this data makes it valuable for researchers and scientists across New Eden.",
