  "description": "Designer: Vallou Outerwear\nWhen Outer Ring Excavations was looking to update and modernize their crew uniforms, they relied on Vallou Outerwear to take on the challenge. Vallou upper management was so impressed with the result, they commissioned a limited range of custom variants, known as the “Hephaestus” collection. \nThese functional but high tech shoes retain the utilitarian look of the original uniforms, but with much higher material quality and attention to detail. Each pair of shoes are crafted from cyan-shaded materials and fabrics that are extremely durable yet comfortable enough to wear for extended periods.",
