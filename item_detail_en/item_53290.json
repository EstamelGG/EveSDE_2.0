  "name": "Capital Trinary State Processor",
  "description": "An information processing component used in Triglavian ship designs and others adapted from such designs. Potentially useful as a component in various other technologies.\n\nTriglavian technologies are designed to be run by trinary-based code and this device is a key component of information processing in such systems. Determining how to interface with and interpret the input and output of such devices was a key breakthrough in the use of Triglavian technology.",
