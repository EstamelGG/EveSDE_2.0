  "description": "Kimotoro Eskeitan command-level officers are picked veterans of the Caldari Navy and elite corporate security force units, and are given broad authority to take command of any forces within the Kimotoro Defense Zone. This emergency authority has been delegated directly to Kimotoro Eskeitan commanders by the Chief Executive Panel, ensuring that all corporate security forces and militia units will obey the orders of the defense zone guards.\n\nFormally called the \"Kimotoro Tivaktikun Sejikiineten Eskeitan\", or Kimotoro Defense Zone Executive Guard, most Caldari know the defense force of the home constellation of the State simply as the Kimotoro Eskeitan. A Caldari Navy unit that answers directly to the Chief Executive Panel, the Kimotoro Eskeitan are often seen performing ceremonial duties in their splendidly caparisoned combat vessels, such as on occasions like the Caldari State Workers Union Day.\n\nFor all the decoration and pomp of their most visible appearances, the Kimotoro Eskeitan are one of the most elite forces in the Caldari State's military and form an essential component of the defensive arrangements of the Caldari home systems. This jacket forms part of the uniform of Kimotoro Eskeitan command-level officers.",
