  "description": "The Transcranial Microcontroller was originally developed by the School of Applied Knowledge with funds from several humanitarian organizations to help catatonics regain consciousness and resume their lives, though in a limited capacity. The microcontroller, which can be used both in humans and machines, proved to be a great success and the Ishukone corporation stepped in and bought the rights to the chip. Since then, further studies by Ishukone technicians have revealed several additional ways the microcontroller can be used, such as control mechanisms in robots for industrial usage. Experts claim that the microchip does not offer higher efficiency in the robots compared to already established methods due to its reliance of a biomechanical host system.",
