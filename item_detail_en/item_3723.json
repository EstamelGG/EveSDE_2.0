  "name": "Slaver Hound",
  "description": "The slaver hound is a native animal of Syrikos V and has been bred by the Amarrians from the time they first settled the planet more than a millennium ago. The favorable experience of employing the slaver hound as a guard animal has led to it being exported from Syrikos V to most other Amarrian agricultural planets and even some industrial and mining ones as well. In recent years, the slaver hound has become fashionable among Amarrians as a pet for those willing to risk its often murderous nature; slaver hounds can become extremely loyal and devoted to their owners if handled with care.",
