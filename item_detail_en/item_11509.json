  "description": "Dating back to the Gallente-Caldari War, the Onyx Heart was created in memory of those brave souls that stayed behind on Caldari Prime to fight the Gallenteans when the rest of the population fled. Awarded only a few dozen times for the duration of the war, the Onyx Heart is only awarded when the well being of the State takes precedence over one's personal welfare.",
