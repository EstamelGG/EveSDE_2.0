  "name": "Women's Triglavian Survival Suit (Perun)",
  "description": "This Triglavian survival suit is marked with the symbol of the Triglavian grouping called the \"Perun Clade\". CONCORD intelligence has established few hard facts about any of the clades but they are clearly major subdivisions within Triglavian society. The Perun Clade is evidently accomplished in space-time mechanics, high-impulse and FTL engine construction, and electronic systems.\n\nAdditionally, the Perun Clade seems to involve itself in matters of strategic leadership of the Collective to a greater degree than other clades. This Triglavian survival suit was probably sourced from the black market and care should be taken to ensure that the bioadaptive technology typically found in such items has been deactivated and removed.",
