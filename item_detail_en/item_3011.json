  "description": "There doesn't appear to be any particular organization here. Dozens of identical copies of everything from period dramas to last week's boxing finals, in cases with obviously home-printed labels.<br><br>\nWhen played, the holos' quality is shabby and rimmed with static, occasionally deteriorating to basic 2-D images. The sound is unreliable and fades at times. Hopefully, the people who buy these copies aren't paying as much as the supplier did for the originals.",
