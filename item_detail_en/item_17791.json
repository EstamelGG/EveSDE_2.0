  "description": "Freedom Fighters have dedicated their life to freeing those who have been enslaved by the Amarr Empire, Khanid Kingdom or various pirate factions. Their purpose is to bring freedom and equality to the population of the galaxy.\n\nBut although their ultimate goal may be noble, their methods are often not approved by the Minmatar authorities, nor their allies the Gallente Federation. Their opponents call them terrorists, and they have been banned from the Caldari State due to the State's historical relationship with the Khanid Kingdom.",
