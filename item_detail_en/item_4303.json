A chief aim of this project is to understand the causes and mechanics driving such incredible destruction. \n\nThis project has compiled all the known data on the subject, including multiple expeditions to “shattered planet” systems (located across both New Eden and wormhole space). We expect to uncover significant details about the mechanics of wormhole initiation as well as the role and power of Isogen-5, which is implicated in the events of that day.\n\n<i>This abstract relates to research undertaken by the Arek'Jaalan Project.</i>\n\n<i>Authorized for capsuleer dissemination under the CONCORD Freedom of Distribution Act (Alpha-One-Five), YC 113.11.4</i>\n\n<i>Further copies of this document can be obtained through the Arek'Jaalan administrative site, located in the <a href=showinfo:5//30003413>Eram</a> system (beacon designation - <b>AJS1: Antiquus</b>).<i>",
