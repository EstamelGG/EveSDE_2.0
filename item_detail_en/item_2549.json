  "description": "This command structure is designed to survive in the harshest planetary environments the universe can offer. The superstructure uses a combination of titanium-steel reinforcement, increasing its overall resilience, and counter-harmonic stabilizers, which keep it level and secure regardless of geological conditions or activity. The entire facility is covered by a skin of adaptive plating originally designed for terraforming platforms, a protective barrier that insulates it from the surrounding environment. Visitors can expect a prolonged and immodest decontamination and pressurization process when first arriving at the command structure. Valuable materials are lifted off world by a bulk payload, reusable rocket, the scattered components of which are retrieved by cargo drones.",
