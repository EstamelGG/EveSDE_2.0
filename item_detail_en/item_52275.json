  "description": "In late YC113, capsuleers staged a mass uprising against the intolerable state of affairs in New Eden's space industries and markets of the day. Protests in Jita centered on a monument in orbit of the Jita IV - Moon 4, Caldari Navy Assembly Plant, the long time center of trading in the Jita market hub.\n\nSuch was the intensity of the protestors' firepower, even the normally adamantine structure of the monument could not stand up to the impacts and it was reduced to a ruin. The ruins of the former monument to the winners of the Ruevo Aram Riddle Contest remain in place as a reminder to all of the central role of capsuleers in New Eden's space-based civilization and to the lesson that change is the only constant in human affairs.",
