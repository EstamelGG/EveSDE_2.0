  "description": "A small-scale replica model of the Fallen Capsuleers Memorial from the system of Molea. It emits a warm glow and has a parting eulogy inscribed on it:\n\n<i>”Eyes forward, capsuleer, the cyno is not yet lit. \n\nConsider your modules, your rigs and ammo before you undock, for the cyno is not yet lit. \n\nBreak free of the station and witness the universe before you, For the cyno is not yet lit. \n\nSet your ship to fly through the vastness while you wait, For the cyno is not yet lit. \n\nPay attention, capsuleer, for those who have gone before you call for you to join them. The cyno is now lit.”</i>",
