  "description": "The Home-15 'Pochven' Filament permits up to 15 ships to travel from Known Space to a system in Triglavian space that is considered the home system of the artificial constellation, or \"Krai\", controlled by a given Triglavian clade.\n\nTriglavian mastery of space-time conduit technology allows them relatively fine control over the generation and targeting of FTL conduits. Certain of the filament devices used by Triglavian forces are connected to systems that are considered the \"home\" systems of the Triglavian Krais, or artifical constellations controlled by each clade. Even those unfamiliar with how to precisely target them will find the conduits they generate will transport them to a \"home system\" in the Triglavian-constructed region of Pochven.",
