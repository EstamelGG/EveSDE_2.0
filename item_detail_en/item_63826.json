  "description": "<font size=\"14\"><b>AIR Explorer</b></font>\n\nThis Expert System is sponsored by the Association for Interdisciplinary Research (AIR) to allow new capsuleers to try out a variety of ships and activities before having to train the required skills. \n\nIt makes skills available that enable a capsuleer to fly all frigates from all four Empires, while its supporting skills make it particularly useful when piloting exploration frigates and performing exploration related activities, such as scanning and hacking.\n\nAn Expert System is a remote, restricted artificial intelligence providing you with access to certain skills during the active period. As it is independent from your clone and your capsule, an active Expert System is not lost on pod death or clone jump.\n\n<i>Expert Systems are a product developed by the PKN Interstellar consortium, made available over the HyperNet FTL communications network, and marketed by PKN Interstellar member corporations. An Expert System is a restricted AI based on artificial gelbrain technology. As the Expert System uses neural pathways based on those created by skill training or skill injection, it is compatible with capsule-ship interface and control systems. Real time command and control communication is achieved using dedicated FTL channels on PKN Interstellar's HyperNet.</i>",
