  "description": "Be ready for battle in our military-grade patented 'Strider' pants. The material is light and comfortable while at the same time able to withstand the rigors of any number of hazardous environments, and the design has been proven to protect all major arteries and vital organs in the case of skirmish, assault or friendly fire. \n\nThis patented black-leather look comes complete with a blastproof belt that's been battletested among private mercenaries, so even if this item of clothing happens to meet the same untimely end as the flesh of its unfortunately out-of-pod owner, you can rest assured that everyone who handles what's left of your corpse will know that you went out in style.",
