  "description": "Obtaining a Deadspace Overseer's personal effects is proof that you have finished clearing all major obstacles in a deadspace pocket and decimated the leading figure. <p>Anyone that procures an OPE (from the pirates themselves, their bases or from guarded containers) can sell them to CONCORD or DED for a reasonable amount of cash. <p>CONCORD has rated Deadspace Overseers by the threat they pose to society and divided them into tiers that dictate how much a seller gets for their effects.",
