A lot has changed in that time; the Sansha incursions, the discovery of new areas of space, the rise of the capsuleer scourge. But some things have stayed the same; people still love our products, we’re all still making a lot of ISK, and we can all still trust in the prosperity brought to us by the Angel-Serpentis pact.\n\nSo let's not dwell on the death and destruction of the past. Instead, this February remember your brother and sister entrepreneur. Send them some love, and save the hostile fire for those who would oppose us. \n\nTogether we can make this our greatest year yet - and crush anyone who stands in our way.",
