  "name": "Replica Gold Magnate Decorative Plating",
  "description": "This is a scale model of a section of decorative plating designed for the port side propulsion pod of a Gold Magnate. As intricately detailed as the real thing, it comes with its own stand for display. With only 1337 numbered issues of this piece produced in celebration of the ascension of Her Holiness Empress Catiz I to the throne, each one is highly valued by collectors across the cluster. Laser cut from the finest pure gold the Empire has to offer, these pieces of art are crafted from left over materials from the production of actual decorative plating now in service on Gold Magnates with the Imperial Guard.",
