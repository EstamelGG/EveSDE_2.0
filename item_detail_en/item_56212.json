  "description": "Subversive elements across New Eden have found something attractive, even uplifting in Zorya Triglav's message of \"proving and joining the flow\". The radicals of the Internal Triglavian Revolutionary Organization, also known as \"Intriguerre\", claim that the Triglavian invasion represents \"a dynamic moment of challenge and opportunity for posthumanity\".\n\nDespite being hunted by agents of CONCORD's Special Affairs for Regulations and Order (SARO), Intriguerre has continued to pump out memetic propaganda and carry out situationist attentats in support of the Collective. Their latest efforts have been aimed at supporting pro-Triglavian capsuleers, with there being some indications that the Triglavians back these efforts.\n\nThis T-shirt has been awarded in the name of Zorya Triglav and is part of a matched set with the 'Kybernaut Clade' Beret also made available to supporters of the Triglavian Collective.",
