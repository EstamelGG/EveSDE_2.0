Detailed analysis of every rogue drone will be carried out and compared to empire equivalents.\n\nWhen completed, this project should enable us to identify any technological links between rogue drones and sleeper drones.\n\n<i>This abstract relates to research undertaken by the Arek'Jaalan Project.</i>\n\n<i>Authorized for capsuleer dissemination under the CONCORD Freedom of Distribution Act (Alpha-One-Five), YC 113.11.4</i>\n\n<i>Further copies of this document can be obtained through the Arek'Jaalan administrative site, located in the <a href=showinfo:5//30003413>Eram</a> system.<i>",
