  "description": "Originally this material was only used in the construction of advanced semiconductors, a role in which it still performs admirably. In recent years, however, structural engineers have proven that it has even better applications in nano-electromechanical systems. The unique “superlubricity” – a state of zero or near-zero friction – between mechanical components made of F.I.G significantly limits wear, allowing the tiny devices to operate for exceptionally long periods without the need for maintenance.",
