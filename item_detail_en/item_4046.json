  "description": "The Odin synthetic eye is a favorite of space jockeys who still need to wine and dine with the best. Nanite-constructed filament-lenses and cutting-edge optics are suspended in a sterile gel, all housed in a membrane of transparent polyethylene terephthalate. The result is a fully functional human optic replacement subtle enough for any occasion.",
