  "description": "This champagne originates from Egghelende III, the planet's major product for export. Shipping it out of the pirate-heavy system makes it pricey enough, but the grapes have proven impossible to cultivate anywhere else in the Federation.<br><br>\nEach case is worth a couple hundred thousand ISK. Each bottle would bring enough planetary cred for a civilian to live comfortably for a year or ten. A bottle or three would definitely be missed.",
