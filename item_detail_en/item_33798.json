  "description": "This outerwear signifies the wearer's regal nature and (some claim) near-divine immortality.\nWith a tattoo of golden decorations on a blood red background, as befits a person who is charged with the caretaking of innumerable souls, on their crew and elsewhere - along with, occasionally, ushering them to their maker - it is an undeniable statement of purpose in this dark and dangerous world. \n\nThe wearer, it says, is not afraid to attract the attention of others, be they admiring or antagonistic; for he follows a mandate greater than that of any mortal man, and he will not, ever, under any circumstances, be stopped.",
