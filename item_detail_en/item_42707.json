  "description": "Designer: Sennda of Emrayur\n\nModeled after the Class B military blouses found in several modern navies, the black leather \"Sterling\" dress blouse is designed to cope with the realities of daily service while maintaining the image of an orderly fighting force. Our dark wool blends are specially treated to resist staining, even tough grease and oil stains common on modern starships, while the blouse's surface texture will feel cool and smooth touch. The blouse is adorned with traditional epaulets and a classic waist cincher.",
