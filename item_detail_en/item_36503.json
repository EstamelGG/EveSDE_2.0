  "description": "Designer: Vallou Outerwear\nWhen Outer Ring Excavations was looking to update and modernize their crew uniforms, they relied on Vallou Outerwear to take on the challenge. Vallou upper management was so impressed with the result, they commissioned a limited range of custom variants, known as the “Hephaestus” collection. \nThese functional but high tech pants retain the utilitarian look of the original uniforms, but with much higher material quality and attention to detail. Each pair of pants are crafted from green-shaded poly fabrics that are extremely durable yet comfortable enough to wear for extended periods. Additional pockets, straps and utility belts allow for a wide range of tools to be carried with the wearer while performing their duties.",
