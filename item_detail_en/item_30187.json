  "description": "Even after millennia of exposure to space, these thruster sections show barely any signs of mechanical wear and appear to be completely functional. The modular design of Sleeper propulsion systems is similar to that of the empires, but deviates in a few interesting areas. \n\nPristine, working examples of Sleeper technology such as this are extremely rare and even more valuable. With the right skills and equipment, they can offer great insights into the scientific pursuits of the ancient race that designed them.",
