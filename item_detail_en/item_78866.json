  "description": "This appears to be the remains of a piece of high-tech black market smuggling equipment, the design of which is thought to have originated from the Satori-Horigu Epistemics corporation. It can electronically conceal contraband items stored within and digitally alter their signatures making them appear as regular, mundane, legal cargo - rendering the illicit contents undetectable by even the most powerful ship and cargo scanners employed by customs and law enforcement agencies in the cluster.",
