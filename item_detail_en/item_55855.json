  "name": "Women's Triglavian Survival Suit (Proving Grounds)",
  "description": "This Triglavian Survival Suit is similar in form to those discovered in Abyssal Deadspace caches and other Triglavian sources but notably lacks the bioadaptive technology-lined full face-plate. Instead of the face-plate, a sophisticated nanoweave half-mask is incorporated into the suit's hood. This contains filter layers providing some protection to the respiratory system. It is unclear if this variant of the suit is used by Triglavians but it can be obtained by those participating in the Triglavian Proving Grounds.",
