  "name": "Women's SOE Enhanced Biosecurity Mask",
  "description": "This is a biosecurity mask enhanced with proprietary filtering and self-sterilizing nanotechnology made available by the Sisters of EVE. The funding for production and distribution of protective equipment of this sort to communities in need is often provided by generous donors. The SOE provide samples of the enhanced biosecurity technology these donations fund to their supporters.\n\nWhile selective molecular repulsion fields are highly effective in repelling airborne pathogens, the use of physical masks remains a standard element of biosecurity protocols for emergency responders, clinicians and researchers. While simple in form, the nanofilter layers in the material of these masks provide protection against pathogens that may be carried through personal molecular repulsion fields in one way or another.",
