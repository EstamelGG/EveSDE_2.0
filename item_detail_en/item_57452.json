  "description": "Isotropic Deposition Guides are molecular-forging tools used to achieve extremely precise uniformity in the assembly of hyper-advanced materials, such as neofullerenes, during molecular-forged reaction processes.\n\nMolecular-forging tools are cutting-edge technologies developed by leading corporations in the core empires' space-industrial complexes. Inevitably, some of these technological wonders have fallen into the hands of criminals and renegade factions.",
