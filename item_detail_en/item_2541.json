  "description": "Barren environment storage units require a great amount of technology to be reliable and effective. The super structure is made from adaptive materials designed to withstand a wide range of extreme weather conditions, as barren planets have little to no atmosphere and are therefore prone to extreme climates. Likewise, each module of the structure is designed to store different states of matter, further compounding preservation and containment concerns.",
