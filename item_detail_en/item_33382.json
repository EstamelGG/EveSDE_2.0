  "description": "For an immortal master of dangerous technological wonders, it can be hard to retain or even recall the connection to the natural cycle of life. This tattoo is a reminder that death for a capsuleer, though only fleeting, is omnipresent and will always leave its mark, and that one person's precious, perfect engine of war will eventually - through accident, scheming, or a second's forgetfulness  - become someone else's wreckage to calmly pick clean.",
