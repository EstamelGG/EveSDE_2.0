  "name": "Women's 'Rocket' Dress (copper)",
  "description": "With its curved, sinuous lines and high collar, the 'Rocket' dress is equally reminiscent of a rocket breaking through the atmosphere and a dagger piercing through skin. A single join snakes through a front showing a murky sky full of stars, overlaid with a fine shoulder brooch and terminating in a short V-shaped edge, while the hands are covered in bronze clasps overlaying a fine pair of brown gloves.",
