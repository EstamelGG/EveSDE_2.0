  "name": "Women's Proven Bioadaptive Mask",
  "description": "The product of a culture long-practised in the art of surviving in hazardous environments, this Bioadaptive Mask is designed to enclose, protect and augment the primary respiratory orifices while leaving the rest of the wearer's face relatively unencumbered. This sophisticated device is equipped with internal forcefield generators able to provide significant full-coverage protection from dangerous environments, or even the cold embrace of vacuum, should the need arise. The mask is a designed to interface with the organic and biomechanical systems of the wearer through its own nanotech interfaces and adaptive implantation systems.\n\nIn many respects this mask appears to be derived in part from the more typical full-face masks worn by the \"troikas\" of the Triglavian Collective, though it clearly lacks some of the more advanced and outright enigmatic elements of such masks. Regardless, the device bears the typical hallmarks of Triglavian technology, with an indefinable lack of regard for integration of the biological with the artificial evident in its underlying design.",
