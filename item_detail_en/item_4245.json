  "description": "Designer: Vallou (Limited Collection)\n\nThe distinctive design of Vallou's officer coats is inspired by historical images of high-ranking military members from the heyday of the Garoun Empire, ancestors of the Gallente Federation. The most prestigious of these was the silver-lined leather coat worn by the Admiral of the Fleet, arguably the most important official in a kingdom so heavily reliant on maritime dominance.\n\nOne of the rarest and most sought-after items in Vallou's renowned Limited Collection, the Silvershore greatcoat is also one of the most expensive articles of clothing ever created. From the top-quality Caillian leather to the burnished platinum clasps, every aspect of this stately raiment has been carefully shaped to evoke the mystery, grandeur and peril of the unexplored.",
