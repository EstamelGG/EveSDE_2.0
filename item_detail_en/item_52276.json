  "description": "The infamous Battle of B-R5RB in January YC116, also known as the \"Titanomachy\", resulted in the destruction of 74 Titan-class starships, after some 21 hours of fighting involving over 7,500 capsuleers. The butcher's bill was hardly restricted to the tally of Titans, which included an additional supercapital ambushed on its way to the battle proper. Some 370 dreadnoughts, 123 carriers and 13 supercarriers were also lost, with innumerable subcapital losses inflicted.\n\nThe scale and breadth of the destruction, involving 55 capsuleer alliances and 717 corporations, was such that a monument to the Titanomachy was established in the wreckage field left behind by the desperate and staggering \"Bloodbath of B-R5RB\".",
