  "name": "Large Crate of Improved Inertial Compensation Systems",
  "description": "The internal components of smaller Minmatar ships are constructed largely of nanofiber mesh which is low-cost, low-mass, and has a lower heat-conduction threshold than most solid industrial sheeting. Unfortunately, the lightweight structures are also susceptible to stress from the high-velocity maneuvers performed by frigate and interceptor pilots, and require added inertial compensation systems and routine inspections.",
