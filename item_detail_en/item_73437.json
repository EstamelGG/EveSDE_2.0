  "name": "Women's 'Domino Rojo' Facial Augmentation",
  "description": "Using state-of-the-art nanocoating technology at a very personal level, facial augmentations can be crafted with striking designs that mask the mesh technology that will boost the wearer's somatosensory systems.\n\nHyper-intensive simulations indicate a more focused and aware connection between an augmented individual's consciousness and their nervous-emotional responses. However, the benefits of this augmentation are not solely limited to improving cognitive interaction with emotional inputs and outputs.\n\nWhether sipping cocktails in the zero-g bars of Caille, or ripping apart the sputtering remains of a pirate vessel with your guns in nullsec, one thing will be certain: those who see your face will have it etched into their memory forever.",
