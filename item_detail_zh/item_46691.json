  "name": "Batch Compressed Arkonor IV-Grade",
  "description": "This extremely rare and valuable variant of arkonor ore was recently discovered by ORE engineers during early field tests of new moon mining technology. Subsequent testing has confirmed that this ore produces 15% more minerals than standard arkonor when reprocessed.\n\nArkonor is one of the rarest and most sought-after ores in the known universe. A sizable nugget of this can sweep anyone from rags to riches in no time. It has high amount of <a href=showinfo:40>Megacyte</a>, and also contains some <a href=showinfo:36>Mexallon</a> and <a href=showinfo:35>Pyerite</a>.\n\n<i>This material was compressed using an older process that compressed batches of raw materials into units using a set input quantity. Newer compression technology uses a more flexible one-to-one unit compression system.</i>",
