  "description": "A well-used camera drone initially recovered from the wreckage of a keepstar in R-AG7W. The ID on the drone shows its owner was part of an independent news team labelled as “Warlock Industries”. \n\nThe drone was scorched while taking an extreme close-up of the explosive force from the Keepstar reactor going critical. \n\nIt is no longer functional, serving as a reminder that empires rise and fall, but news coverage is eternal.",
