  "description": "Initially found in an auxiliary broadcast studio at the Expert Distribution Warehouse in Siseide, where the walls of the studio had been plastered with cartoonish anthropomorphic characters in a storyboard style. The foreword mentions that it was originally intended to appear in a black-market show called “The Cope,” but had been adapted for scripted media. \n\nIt appears to be largely propaganda focused on how various low-security-based alliances would deliberately corrupt a solar system to facilitate the use of “bubbles” then “Yolo Dreads for fun”. The reductive instructions that follow seem to depict various suggested methods for others to “enjoy themselves” alongside some scripture about a “Rat God”.",
