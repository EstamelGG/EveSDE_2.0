  "description": "Bound in weathered synth-leather and secured with a heat-resistant clasp, this worn little cookbook is beloved by pilots with a sweet tooth and too much downtime in deep space. Its pages are filled with recipes for comforting snacks, including one legendary delicacy: a filled lattice of thin, crispy batter pressed together until warm and chewy. The margins are cluttered with notes about optimal heating cycles, field-tested substitutions, and the perfect ratios of sugar and flour. Rumor has it the original recipe came from a Thukker engineer who refused to share it unless bribed with ship parts.",
