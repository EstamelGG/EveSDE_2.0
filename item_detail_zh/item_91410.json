  "name": "Suspicious “mining permit”",
  "description": "A well-used, slightly dog-eared single-page permit allowing its bearer to safely mine in the location it has been issued in. The wording of the document appears to state phrases like “officially certified” and “meets safety standards” multiple times, yet it offers no friend-or-foe recognition or electronic tagging for approval, suggesting that whoever issued this permit intended for it to be only verifiable once recovered from the owner’s ship wreckage.",
